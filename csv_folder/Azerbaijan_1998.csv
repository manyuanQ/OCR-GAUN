ANNEX II Elements recommended for inclusion in model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters A, General recommendation 1. Model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters should reflect in statutory terms the general provisions of the Model Treaty on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, together with the recommendations contained in annex I above. To the extent possible, it should provide different options for States with different legal systems. Where relevant, it should take into account provisions of the model bill on mutual assistance in criminal matters developed in 1998 by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme. B. Scope 2. The model legislation should provide a full range of flexible options for assuming mutual assistance obligations. When there is a treaty on mutual assistance in criminal matters, the terms of that treaty should govern the relationship. The legislation should also permit mutual assistance to be provided without a treaty, with or without reciprocity. C. Jurisdiction 3. The model legislation could contain provisions to provide for jurisdiction, inter alia: (a) To issue judicial orders necessary for executing mutual assistance requests; (b) To authorize the requested State to act on behalf or for the benefit of, or to represent the interests of, the requesting State in legal proceedings necessary for executing mutual assistance requests; (c) To punish perjury committed during mutual assistance, in particular perjury committed during videoconferencing. D. Procedure 4. The model legislation should include options for procedures dealing with both incoming and outgoing requests for assistance in criminal matters. Such procedures should be in conformity with, whenever applicable, international and regional human rights instruments. Where no treaty provision is applicable, the legislation could also contain provisions on specific forms of mutual assistance, including testimony and other forms of cooperation carried out via video link, cooperation in asset seizure and forfeiture, and temporary transfer of witnesses in custody. 5. The model legislation could provide for the establishment of a central authority or authorities for the receipt and transmission of requests and the provision of advice and assistance to relevant authorities. The legislation could also specify the extent of the central authority’s powers. E. Communications 6. | Where no treaty provision is applicable, the legislation should set forth the means of communicating between the requesting State and the requested State, allowing for use of the most modern forms of communication.",04/27/1998,1998_257437,Azerbaijan,"1 1.
