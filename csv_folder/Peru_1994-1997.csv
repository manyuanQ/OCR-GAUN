Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons suffering from economic, social or legal disadvantage heightens their vulnerability to the risk of HIV infection, Noting that, according to a report submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses the risk of transmission of HIV, Concerned at evidence indicating that groups in society suffering discrimination in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and disadvantage with respect to their access to education, health care and social services, are as a result more vulnerable to the risk of infection and to the personal and social impact of the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social welfare which deny people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, as well as high-risk groups, enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms, Concerned that the fear and ignorance surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there

counter-productive to measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, and that anti-discrimination measures form a component part of an effective public health strategy, Emphasizing the responsibility of

Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3.

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people

reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned

to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after

Considering that the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the basic purposes of the United Nations enshrined in the Charter of the

at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the

the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Mindful of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which reaffirms, in article 19, the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or through any other media of their choice, E/CN.4/1997/L.56 page 2 Mindful also that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also states that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but that these should be only such as are provided by law and are necessary for the respect of the rights and reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or public order (ordre public) or of public health or morals, and that any propaganda for war or any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law, Mindful further of the need to ensure that unjustified invocation of national security to restrict the right to freedom of expression and information does not take place, Taking note of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information adopted by a group of experts meeting in South Africa on 1 October 1995, which are annexed to the report submitted by the Special Rapporteur to the Commission at its fifty-second session on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (E/CN.4/1996/39), Considering the promotion and protection of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and impart information, as well as the rights to peaceful assembly and association, to be essential to popular participation in decision-making processes and to the realization of all the rights set forth in international human rights instruments and to be interrelated with, and to enhance, the exercise of these human rights, Considering also that a deterioration in the right to exercise freedom of expression could be indicative of a further weakening in the protection and enjoyment of human rights in a country, Reaffirming the interrelation and interdependence between the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression and the full enjoyment of the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and the importance of a free flow and wider dissemination of information to and from developing countries, Considering that the effective promotion and protection of the human rights of persons who exercise the right to freedom of opinion and expression are of fundamental importance to the safeguarding of human dignity, E/CN.4/1997/L.56 page 3 Reaffirming that education is an integral component of the full and effective participation of persons in a free society, in particular for the full enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and that the eradication of illiteracy is very important to the achievement of these goals and to the development of the human person, Recalling its resolution 1996/53 of 19 April 1996, in which it decided to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further three years, Deeply concerned at numerous reports of detention of, as well as discrimination,

translators, publishers, broadcasters, printers and distributors, and, in this context, taking note of all other resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights that address the question of the full enjoyment and exercise by everyone of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Taking note of the need to raise awareness about the interrelationship between the use and availability of new media of communication, including modern telecommunications technology, and the right to freedom of expression and information, and of the efforts made in this regard in a number of international and regional forums, and mindful of provisions of relevant instruments, Deeply concerned that for women there exists a gap between the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the effective enjoyment of that right, and that this gap contributes to inadequate action by Governments in the integration of the human rights of women into the mainstream of their human rights activities, 1. Reaffirms its commitment to the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (E/CN.4/1997/31 and Add.1) and of the comments and analysis contained therein, including that the right to freedom of opinion and expression is a prerequisite to ensuring public participation in decision-making processes; 3.
