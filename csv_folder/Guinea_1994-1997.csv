A/49/234 English Page 2  ANNEX  Explanatory memorandum  Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has shown a continuing interest in the study of the question of capital punishment, with a view to promoting full respect for everyone’s right to life, and has taken various initiatives aiming at reaching the ultimate goal of abolishing the death penalty in all countries. Among these is General Assembly resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which the Assembly adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The question of capital punishment has become particularly urgent in recent times, in view of the continuing high number of death sentences and executions in various parts of the world. On 4 October 1994, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution in which it underlined this urgency and asked all States that had not yet abolished capital punishment to do so rapidly. We also would like to recall the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 March 1992 pointing in the same direction.  In accordance with such a line, our countries have decided to promote appropriate action within the United Nations, aiming at contributing to an eventual abolition of capital punishment. This initiative reflects the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of our peoples, who are firmly opposed to the imposition of the death penalty anywhere in the world.  Therefore, we would like to request the inclusion of the question of capital punishment in the agenda of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly,  and to this end submit the attached    resolution.  In our view, the Third Committee is the most appropriate forum in which to consider the question of capital punishment. We therefore recommend that the proposed item be assigned to the Third Committee.  A/49/234 English Page 3  APPENDIX       resolution","The General Assembly, Recalling article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms everyone’s right to life, Recalling its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971 and 32/61 of 8 December 1977, as well as resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which it adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolutions 1574 (L) of 20 May 1971, 1745 (LIV) of 16 May 1973, 1930 (LVIII) of 6 May 1975, 1985/33 of 29 May 1985, 1990/29 of 24 May 1990 and 1990/51 of 24 July 1990, Deeply concerned about the fact that capital punishment is still retained and used for ordinary crimes by a consistent number of Member States and that several countries impose the death penalty in disregard of the safeguards provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for juveniles and pregnant women, Commending the fact that both in the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, established by the Security Council in its resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, and in the statute for an international criminal court, elaborated by the International Law Commission, capital punishment is excluded from the penalties that these courts are authorized to impose, Believing that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights, 1.  Calls upon all Governments in a position to do so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Invites all States, referring to its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) and 32/61, to consider the progressive restriction of the number of offences for which the death penalty may be imposed and the exclusion of juveniles and pregnant women from capital executions; 3. Encourages all Member States to consider the opportunity of introducing the necessary amendments in their legislation with a view to the desirability of abolishing the death penalty in all countries, thus promoting full respect for everyone’s right to life, as well as for the expectation of every human being not to be killed following a legal sentence or judicial measure; 4. Also encourages all States to consider the opportunity of instituting moratoria on pending executions, with a view to ensuring that the principle that no State should dispose of the life of any human being is affirmed in every part of the world by the year 2000.

On this principle there is general agreement. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, this principle should be reflected in the Organization’s functioning in the equal treatment accorded to the official and working languages of the United Nations. It sometimes happens, however, that this essential principle of equality is not respected in the different bodies. Various justifications are cited: financial reasons, the unavailability of interpretation or translation services, the urgent nature of the work at hand, and so on. In the heat of the moment, some delegations may be tempted not to react when asked to waive their right to work in the official language of the Organization chosen by them and to be provided with documentation in that language. In the long term, however, this waiver has a particularly nefarious effect in that it is the embryonic form of a tendency to accept a virtually monolingual United Nations. Far from being simpler, cheaper or better, failure on the Organization’s part to respect the multilingualism which is its rule and which it should strictly enforce would necessarily lead to the decline and impoverishment of discussions, to the development of stereotypes, to bureaucracy and to a waning of the interest of peoples in the United Nations. It would be wrong, however, to fall into the trap of believing that such a trend is inevitable. All that is required is vigilance to insist at all times that Member States should receive from the Organization the service to which they are entitled under the constitutional texts. This means, in particular, that the Secretariat should make it a rule to employ in its relations with Member States the official language which the latter choose to use. This requirement naturally has implications in terms of the linguistic skills which should rightfully be expected from staff of the United Nations. It may be useful to recall this unequivocally. It is noticeable that the staffing of the interpretation and translation services has not expanded at the same rate as the increase in the activities of the various United Nations bodies over the past few years. As a result, there are delays in making documents available in the official languages and meetings are postponed because of the lack of teams of interpreters. All this hampers the proper functioning of the Organization and gives the impression that the delegations which insist on having the services required for the meaningful practice of multilingualism are troublemakers who are overly intransigent. This is a very serious perversion of the system and the only way to avoid it is for the interpretation and translation services to have staff and resources which, Joes despite budgetary constraints, remain adequate to deal with the increasing workload. The practice of holding ""informal"" meetings without interpretation or circulating ""unofficial"" documents in one language only can in no way be an acceptable solution to these shortcomings. Cultural and linguistic diversity is a responsible choice which the United Nations is perfectly able to make if it exhibits in this regard the far- sightedness and determination that are necessary in order to avoid taking the easy way out. The resolution submitted by the signatories is intended precisely to recall this constant objective, this requirement which is particularly relevant at the dawn of the second fifty years of the Organization’s existence.

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION-INTERPOL: PRESENTATION, OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES  The International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol (ICPO-Interpol) is an organization of international character in which 176 States are represented. It is an intergovernmental organization that fulfils the criteria for the granting of observer status with the General Assembly laid down in decision 49/426 of 9 December 1994.  The General Secretariat of ICPO-Interpol has been located in Lyons, France, since 1989. A Headquarters Agreement, which came into force on 14 February 1984, grants the organization privileges and immunities on French territory.  The organization’s roots go back to the First International Criminal Police Congress, which was held in Monaco in 1914, and its existence became official in 1923, when it was established as the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC). The Commission’s headquarters were located in Vienna, Austria, and it was basically a European organization intended to facilitate international police cooperation and to keep records of international crime and criminals. IcPC functioned until the outbreak of the Second World War, when, to all intents and purposes, it ceased to exist, other than as an instrument of the Nazis.  In 1946, new statutes were adopted and the headquarters were transferred to Paris. In 1956, when it had more than 50 member States, it became the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol with a new Constitution designed to respond better to the growing needs of international cooperation.  Interpol is therefore one of the oldest organizations of an international character and one of those with the largest number of members.  The mission of the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol is to combat international offences against ordinary criminal law while respecting human rights and the laws of its members. It is prohibited from taking any action in cases of a political, military, religious or racial nature. These obligations are specified in its Constitution.  Since 1984, the organization has had a Supervisory Board for the internal control of its archives which is composed of members who have all achieved distinction in their own fields. The Board verifies the pertinence and legitimacy of the information in the organization’s archives, either on its own initiative or at the request of a national of a member State of ICPO-Interpol.  The permanent departments of ICPO-Interpol constitute the General Secretariat, which has approximately 330 officials. The General Secretariat  Jase  A/51/141 English Page 4  works closely with the National Central Bureaus (NCBs) to ensure the functioning of international police cooperation and implements the decisions and recommendations that emanate from the organization’s two governing bodies, the Executive Committee and the General Assembly.  A National Central Bureau is a national body responsible for liaison with the other NCBs and with the General Secretariat; this is an original feature of the structure of Interpol.  International police cooperation within Interpol is based on the fundamental principles listed below:  - Respect for national sovereignty. Cooperation is based on actions taken by the police forces in the various member States operating within their own national boundaries and in accordance with their own national laws;  - Enforcement of ordinary criminal law. The organization’s field of activity is limited to crime prevention and law enforcement in connection with ordinary criminal offences; this is the only basis on which there can be agreement between all members;  - Universality. Any member may cooperate with any other, and cooperation must not be impeded by geographic or linguistic factors (four working languages are used at the General Secretariat);  - Equality of all members. All member States are provided with the same services and have the same rights, irrespective of the size of their financial contributions to the organization;  - Extension of cooperation to other agencies. Cooperation is extended through the National Central Bureaus to any government agency concerned with combating ordinary criminal offences;  - Flexibility of working methods. Although governed by principles designed to ensure regularity and continuity, working methods are flexible enough to take into account the wide variety of structures and situations in different countries.  ICPO-Interpol, at the heart of the web of information exchanged between 176 countries, is in an exceptional position to fight crime. It has highly sophisticated computer systems and an equally advanced worldwide telecommunications network that makes it possible to transmit information from one continent to another in a matter of minutes and with absolute security. The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition.  A/51/141 English Page 5  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering, where transnational movements are very difficult to trace. Finally, ICPO-Interpol cooperates on a day-to-day basis with many international organizations.  II. THE STATUS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANI ZATION-INTERPOL VIS-A-VIS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY  The International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol provides the machinery used by many countries both to transmit their requests for extradition (the European Convention on Extradition, signed in Paris in 1957) and for mutual assistance in criminal matters (European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959), and to combat various forms of crime, particularly drug trafficking (United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, adopted in Vienna on 20 December 1988) and currency counterfeiting (1929 Geneva International Convention on the Suppression of Currency Counterfeiting, for which ICPO- Interpol acts as the central international office).  Also worthy of note are the close working relations the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol maintains with the major international organizations.  In the forefront of these is the United Nations, whose Legal Counsel confirmed the status of ICPO-Interpol as an intergovernmental organization ina memorandum dated 14 December 1982.  On 20 May 1971, ICPO-Interpol and the Economic and Social Council concluded a special agreement, which provided for the sharing of information and documentation, for consultation and technical cooperation on matters of common interest, for the representation of each organization by observers at the other’s meetings and for the possibility of each one submitting written statements to the other and proposing the inclusion of items on its agenda.  The special arrangement approved by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1579 (L) of 20 May 1981 provides for cooperation with the United Nations Secretariat and therefore constitutes - in the view of the United Nations Legal Counsel - a sufficient legal basis for cooperation with the United Nations Secretariat and the secretariats of subsidiary bodies, which gives the arrangement very wide scope.  ICPO-Interpol also concluded a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the Council of Europe on 9 February 1960. This is reflected by both organizations’ participation in many joint activities.  A/51/141 English Page 6  It would probably be tedious to list all the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with which Interpol cooperates almost every day. However, by way of illustration, we might mention that these intergovernmental organizations include the World Customs Organization (WCO) for matters related to customs offences, particularly smuggling and drug trafficking, and non-governmental organizations include End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) on matters relating to child prostitution and sex tourism in Asia.  Finally, in connection with the establishment of its various subregional bureaus, Interpol has concluded headquarters agreements with Thailand, Argentina, Céte d’Ivoire and Zimbabwe.  III. ADVANTAGES TO BE DERIVED FROM GRANTING THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION-INTERPOL OBSERVER STATUS IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY  When it met at Beijing from 4 to 10 October 1995 at its sixty-fourth session, the ICPO-Interpol General Assembly clearly expressed its wish to obtain observer status for the organization in the United Nations General Assembly.  The reasons for this included ""... the need to avoid any duplication of personnel, procedures and computer systems in the international fight against crime in order to prevent any unnecessary expenditure and diverging strategies ... and also ... the need to fight crime on a worldwide basis in order to prevent certain countries bound by regional agreements from feeling self-sufficient in the fight against crime ..."" (resolution AGN/64/RES/11).  The attached list of joint or complementary activities carried on by the United Nations and Interpol on the basis of the Economic and Social Council special arrangement is an impressive one. It proves - if proof were needed - that the two organizations cooperate in practically all sectors relating to crime prevention and law enforcement.  And yet this list is, by its very nature, self-limiting, for it is difficult to see how such cooperation can be harmonized, reinforced or even extended without coordination at the very highest level.  In that connection, the following passage from a document issued at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime, organized by the United Nations in Naples from 21 to 23 November 1994, is relevant:  ""It is important to build on the work of existing organizations, such as the International Criminal Police Organization-Interpol (ICPO-Interpol) and others, and to consolidate the very extensive but still ad hoc arrangements that currently exist for cooperation so as to consolidate these activities and achieve more effective and efficient outputs. Cooperative institutions and arrangements already in place include ICPO- Interpol, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering set up by the  Joes  A/51/141 English Page 7  group of seven major industrialized countries, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Schengen Group and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. Contacts, coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged. In particular, it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical, bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping"" (item 6 of the provisional agenda, entitled ""Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative, prosecutorial and judicial levels"") (E/CONF.88/4, para. 26).  We feel that a partial - but vital - response to these remarks lies in granting ICPO-Interpol observer status, which would enable both organizations to promote and strengthen the integration of their crime prevention efforts and to establish joint law enforcement policies, thus avoiding duplication or even contradiction in the definition of those policies. We are convinced that in their pursuit of their fundamental goals, both organizations will benefit.  For some time now, ICPO-Interpol has been engaged in a regionalization process, and it has decided to establish subregional bureaus in Asia, Africa and South America. The United Nations will undoubtedly find this development a help in attaining its international objectives, which it will be able to pursue more effectively at a regional level.  Moreover, participation of ICPO-Interpol in sessions of the General Assembly as an observer will help ICPO-Interpol achieve greater success in its mission, which is to fight international crime in all its forms, while upholding human rights.

ICPO-Interpol is currently collaborating on a European project on the prevention and control of the theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles. UNESCO attends meetings organized by the General Secretariat on the illicit traffic of works of art and we assist them in the organization of their regional workshops. UNESCO also receives international art notices produced by the General Secretariat. The General Secretariat has observer status at the annual sessions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, which reports directly to the Economic and Social Council. The arms and explosives specialized officer recently participated in the first meeting of the United Nations project on firearms regulations, which was organized by the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch. An exchange of information on organized crime has recently been established with this body. ICPO-Interpol is regularly invited to ICAO meetings, and they in turn attend our conferences on both international terrorism and fraudulent travel documents. The General Secretariat also receives from ICAO all documents relating to aviation security, and a joint training programme for trainers was established in 1993. Since the creation of the Interpol Standing Committee on Disaster Victim Identification in 1981, ICAO has been invited to attend its annual meetings.

Cooperation on the illegal traffic of hazardous waste. There has recently been an exchange of letters confirming the exchange of information and mutual observer status at relevant meetings. The relationship between ICPO-Interpol and the CITES secretariat, which has existed for several years, has been formalized by an exchange of letters confirming their status as a permanent observer at relevant Interpol meetings. IAEA participates as an observer in the ICPO- Interpol meetings on environmental crime and the illegal traffic in radioactive and nuclear substances. Interpol has participated in two meetings hosted by IAEA and they have recently expressed the desire to formalize our mutual cooperation. The relationship of ICPO-Interpol with the Economic and Social Council dates back to 1961, when the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was adopted. In 1971, Interpol participated in the United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1988, Interpol participated in the United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. ICPO-Interpol was recognized as a conduit through which legal/judicial inquiries could be passed. At the Conference a resolution regarding the exchange of information was passed which recommended that the widest possible use should be made by police authorities of the records and communications system of ICPO-Interpol in achieving the goals of the United Nations Convention. On an annual basis, the General Secretariat provides the 13 members of the International Narcotics Control Board with an in-depth briefing on worldwide illicit drug trafficking and use trends. These vital data, which are collated and analysed from seizure information received at the General Secretariat from the organization’s 176 member countries, become an integral part of the annual report of INCB. United Nations body Nature of the relationship Commission on Narcotic Drugs ST form United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) UNDCP statistical coordination project The Conference on Chemical Control Operations organized by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency and INCB and hosted by Interpol in 1991 recommended that a working group be established to prepare guidelines for use by national authorities in preventing the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals. ICPO-Interpol participated in all three meetings that were subsequently convened by INCB to formulate the guidelines. ICPO-Interpol participated in a number of meetings on the subject of the prevention of diversion of precursors and essential chemicals, and these meetings have generally been convened in cooperation with other organizations such as the Pompidou Group (Council of Europe) and the European Commission. ICPO-Interpol actively participated in the sessions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in an observer capacity, and a report on the worldwide illicit drug trafficking situation and trends is presented to the Commission. In 1960, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs adopted a resolution in which it requested the Secretary- General, in consultation with ICPO-Interpol and other organizations concerned, to work out and take suitable measures to simplify, within the limits allowed by the provisions of international conventions, the communication of reports on cases of illicit traffic. In application of the resolution, the United Nations and ICPO-Interpol decided to use a standard form. This was, perhaps, the first step towards effecting coordination in the collection of drug-related information by the United Nations and ICPO- Interpol. This form, known as the ST form, is still used by ICPO-Interpol as well as by the United Nations. Interpol actively participates in the regional meetings of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies and subcommission meetings, and assists in workshops and plenary sessions. UNDCP is also invited to attend the ICPO-Interpol European regional conferences in an observer capacity. ICPO is currently engaged in a joint project with UNDCP and the World Customs Organization to create a drug seizure statistical database. The objective is to improve the analysis of drug seizure data. United Nations body Nature of the relationship Division of Narcotic Drugs/United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) /UNDCP UNFDAC/UNDCP/INCB Audio Visual Drug Training Programme Universal Postal Union (UPU) World Health Organization (WHO) International Court of Justice Since 1985, ICPO-Interpol has on different occasions accompanied members of UNFDAC, and later UNDCP, on fact-finding missions relative to the illicit drug trafficking situation in various geographic regions of the world (i.e. South America, the Near and Middle East and ""Balkan Route"" countries). Financial assistance for the second edition of this programme (1982) was provided by UNFDAC. As a result, the General Secretariat developed a training course in 1985 designed to prevent the diversion of psychotropic substances from legitimate commerce to the illicit markets. Since 1992, ICPO-Interpol has assisted INCB in the conduct of training seminars held in all regions of the world for drug control administrators. Between 1988 and 1992 ICPO-Interpol has participated as lecturers in UPU training seminars on the detection of drugs concealed in postal parcels. ICPO-Interpol also participates in a biannual Conference held at Bern to discuss matters related to mail and aviation security. Cooperation between Interpol and WHO started more than a decade ago. Assistance has been provided to the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence and the Programme Planning Working Group by way of statistical data collected via special surveys and by technical law enforcement advice. Information/ data provided was instrumental to the decision- making process of the Committees in the scheduling and/or re-scheduling of pharmaceutical drugs. Interpol also contributed in a similar manner to the Meeting on Drug Related Deaths held at Geneva in November 1993. Interpol assists the International Court of Justice in advertising and circulating the warrants of arrest at an international level through the Automatic Search Facility and notices systems.

Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1997/40); 2. Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and, therefore, calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system-wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms; 3. Encourages the efforts made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, within his mandate established by the General Assembly in resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, to coordinate E/CN.4/1997/L.75 page 3 the activities of relevant United Nations organs, bodies and mechanisms dealing with human rights in considering violations of the human rights of women and welcomes in this regard the initiative of the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive review of the technical cooperation programme from a gender perspective; 4. Also encourages the strengthening of cooperation and coordination among all human rights treaty bodies, special rapporteurs, special procedures and other human rights mechanisms of the Commission and the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, and requests that they regularly and systematically take a gender perspective into account in the implementation of their mandates, including information and qualitative analysis in their reports on violations of the human rights of women; 5. Welcomes, in this regard, the paper * prepared by the United Nations Development Fund for Women for the meeting of the special rapporteurs, special representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of the working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights held from 28 to 30 May 1996 * and the description therein that gender-specific reporting and analysis is an examination of the effects of gender on the form which a human rights violation takes, the circumstances in which a particular violation occurs, the consequences for the victim, and the availability and accessibility of remedies, and urges the implementation of the recommendations pertaining to working methods and reporting methodology including sources of information and gender-specific analysis in conclusions and recommendations; 6. Calls for the further strengthening of cooperation and coordination between the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women and between the Centre for Human Rights and the Division for the Advancement of Women through, inter alia, regular inter-secretariat cooperation to ensure that the joint work plan of the Centre for Human Rights and the Division for the Advancement of Women reflects all aspects of work under way and identifies where obstacles/impediments exist and areas for *E/CN.4/1997/131, annex. ’See E/CN.4/1997/3.

Recognizes that the success of mainstreaming women's rights will depend on the formalizing, at the highest levels, of a clear policy and guidelines on the integration of a gender perspective into the United Nations human rights system, and draws attention to the need to develop practical strategies to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the expert group meeting on the development of guidelines for the integration of a gender perspective into human rights activities and programmes; * 8.

Affirms that it is the responsibility of all treaty bodies, in their work, to integrate a gender perspective and in order to do so, the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General should be given due consideration, in particular to: (a) Develop gender-sensitive guidelines to be used in the review of States parties' reports; (b) Develop, as a matter of priority, a common strategy towards mainstreaming the human rights of women into their work, so that each body, within its mandate, monitors the human rights of women; (c) Incorporate a gender analysis and regularly exchange information in the development of general comments and recommendations with a view to the preparation of general comments which reflect a gender perspective; (d) Incorporate a gender perspective into concluding observations so that the concluding observations of each treaty body delineate the strengths and weaknesses of each State party insofar as enjoyment by women of the rights guaranteed by a particular treaty is concerned; 10. Urges States to limit the extent of any reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, formulate any such reservations as precisely and as narrowly as possible, °E/CN.4/1996/105, annex. E/CN.4/1997/L.75 page 5 ensure that no reservations are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention or otherwise incompatible with international treaty law, and regularly review them with a view to withdrawing them; 12.
