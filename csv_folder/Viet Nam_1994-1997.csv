On this principle there is general agreement. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , this principle should be reflected in the Organizationâs functioning in the equal treatment accorded to the official and working languages of the United Nations. It sometimes happens, however, that this essential principle of equality is not respected in the different bodies. Various justifications are cited: financial reasons, the unavailability of interpretation or translation services, the urgent nature of the work at hand, and so on. In the heat of the moment, some delegations may be tempted not to react when asked to waive their right to work in the official language of the Organization chosen by them and to be provided with documentation in that language. In the long term, however, this waiver has a particularly nefarious effect in that it is the embryonic form of a tendency to accept a virtually monolingual United Nations. Far from being simpler, cheaper or better, failure on the Organizationâs part to respect the multilingualism which is its rule and which it should strictly enforce would necessarily lead to the decline and impoverishment of discussions, to the development of stereotypes, to bureaucracy and to a waning of the interest of peoples in the United Nations. It would be wrong, however, to fall into the trap of believing that such a trend is inevitable. All that is required is vigilance to insist at all times that Member States should receive from the Organization the service to which they are entitled under the constitutional texts. This means, in particular, that the Secretariat should make it a rule to employ in its relations with Member States the official language which the latter choose to use. This requirement naturally has implications in terms of the linguistic skills which should rightfully be expected from staff of the United Nations. It may be useful to recall this unequivocally. It is noticeable that the staffing of the interpretation and translation services has not expanded at the same rate as the increase in the activities of the various United Nations bodies over the past few years. As a result, there are delays in making documents available in the official languages and meetings are postponed because of the lack of teams of interpreters. All this hampers the proper functioning of the Organization and gives the impression that the delegations which insist on having the services required for the meaningful practice of multilingualism are troublemakers who are overly intransigent. This is a very serious perversion of the system and the only way to avoid it is for the interpretation and translation services to have staff and resources which, Joes despite budgetary constraints, remain adequate to deal with the increasing workload. The practice of holding ""informal"" meetings without interpretation or circulating ""unofficial"" documents in one language only can in no way be an acceptable solution to these shortcomings. Cultural and linguistic diversity is a responsible choice which the United Nations is perfectly able to make if it exhibits in this regard the far- sightedness and determination that are necessary in order to avoid taking the easy way out. The resolution submitted by the signatories is intended precisely to recall this constant objective, this requirement which is particularly relevant at the dawn of the second fifty years of the Organizationâs existence. APPENDIX Draft resolution Multilingualism The General Assembly , Recalling its resolutions 2 (I) of 1 February 1946, 2241 B (XXI) of 20 December 1966, 2292 (XXII) of 8 December 1967, 2359 B (XXII) of 19 December 1967, 2479 (XXIII) and 2480 B (XXIII) of 21 December 1968, 3189 (XXVIII), 3190 (XXVIII) and 3191 (XXVIII) of 18 December 1973 and 43/224 D of 21 December 1988, Recalling also, on the occasion of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, that the universality of the United Nations and its corollary of multilingualism require each State Member of the Organization, whatever the official or working language in which it expresses itself, to make itself understood just as it should endeavour to understand others, Stressing the need for strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the different bodies and organs of the United Nations, Regretting that unequal use is made of the different working languages and official languages within the United Nations, and desiring that persons recruited by the Organization should have a command of and make use of at least one working language and one official language, Considering that the translation and interpretation budgets of United Nations bodies should be commensurate with requirements and exempt from any restrictive budgetary measures, as recalled in resolution 42/207 C of 11 December 1987, Noting that the principle of equality of the official languages and of the working languages is being called into question with increasing frequency by the holding of so-called ""reduced cost"" informal meetings, 1. Invites Member States and the Secretary-General to ensure the strict application of the resolutions establishing language arrangements; 2. Recalls that the Secretariat is required, in its relations with Member States, to use the official or working language requested by these States; 3. Invites the Secretary-General to ensure that, in conformity with resolution 2480 B (XXIII), personnel recruited by the different bodies of the Organization have a command of and make use of at least one working language and one official language; 4. Stresses the need to ensure, in particular by the training and recruitment of specialists, that the necessary resources are available to guarantee the timely translation of documents into the different official and working languages of the United Nations; 5. Recalls the need to ensure the simultaneous distribution of these documents in the official and working languages of the Organization; 6. Stresses the usefulness of ensuring that adequate publications and data banks in the different official and working languages are available to the libraries and documentation centres of the various bodies; 7. Requests the delegations of Member States and the Secretariat to limit the holding of informal meetings without interpretation; 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to it at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of this resolution, and on the use of the official and working languages of the United Nations.",07/20/1995,1995_185275,Viet Nam,"@) General Assembly oiste, ââ 3GENERALA/50/14720 July 1995 ENGLISHORIGINAL: FRENCHFiftieth sessionREQUEST FOR THE INCLUSION OF AN ITEM IN THE PROVISIONAL AGENDA OF THE FIFTIETH SESSIONMULTILINGUALISMLetter dated 20 July 1995 from the representatives of",yes

Uniting 44 countries and Governments that use the French language, ACTC is the sole intergovernmental organization representing the French-speaking world. It is the expression of a new solidarity and is an additional means of bringing peoples closer together through a permanent dialogue between cultures and respect for the sovereignty and cultural identity of its members. 3. In addition to the forum for dialogue and South-South and North-South cooperation that it provides, since it brings together countries and Governments of Africa, Europe, America and Asia (nearly one out of every four countries in the world), ACTC engages in multilateral cooperation among its members in areas of interest to the United Nations, including the following: (a) Law in the service of development and democracy (legal and judicial cooperation, protection and promotion of human rights, support for democratic processes and parliamentary and judicial institutions ...); (b) Education and training; (c) Culture and communication; (d) Technical cooperation and economic development (particularly in the fields of energy, environment and scientific and technical information) . 4. As part of its activities, ACTC has entered into relations and concluded agreements with a number of agencies of the United Nations system; these agreements have resulted in cooperative activities in the countries members of ACTC, especially in the following areas: (a) Observation of elections; (b) Strengthening of national and regional institutions in support of the democratic process; (c) Promotion of human rights; (d) Promotion of the rights of the child; (e) Economic development; (Â£) Environment; (g) Energy; (h) Literacy campaigns; (i) Support for educational systems; (3) Protection of heritage. 5. Moreover, through its political organs, namely, the Francophone Conference of Heads of State and Government, the Ministerial Conference of French-speaking Countries and the Permanent Council of French-speaking Countries, ACTC promotes and supports the participation of its member countries in meetings and conferences organized under United Nations auspices. These include the following: (a) World Summit for Children (New York, 1990); (b) United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992); (c) Meetings of negotiating groups on desertification and climate change; (d) World Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993); (e) Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Barbados, 1994); (f) International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994); (g) World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1994); (h) Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995). 6. The Heads of State and Government that use French as a common language, meeting in Grand-Baie, Mauritius, in October 1993, adopted a special resolution on the French-speaking community and international relations, in which, after having reiterated their solidarity and their firm desire to join efforts to build a better future for their peoples and the international community, expressly affirmed: (a) Their firm commitment that they share with other international bodies efforts to find appropriate solutions to the major political and economic problems of todayâs world; (b) Their determination to develop, within these bodies, as well as at major international conferences, an ongoing in-depth dialogue among the nations of the French-speaking world; (c) Their support for activities to ensure that the French-speaking community maintains a dynamic presence in international affairs, within the framework of a new partnership with all the organizations that make up the United Nations family. 7. It was from its policy of openness and wish to cooperate with international organizations, in particular with the United Nations, that ACTC opened, in 1991, an office at the United Nations Office at Geneva, which provides: (a) A place for meeting and dialogue for French-speaking delegations participating in the many meetings organized by the United Nations in Geneva; (b) A base for French-speaking countries that do not have a permanent mission in Geneva; (c) A place for maintaining liaison with the United Nations Secretariat and partner specialized agencies. ACTC recently opened a similar office at United Nations Headquarters in New York, which also has the task of maintaining liaison with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 8. Sharing the same ideas and pursuing the same objectives of peace, stability and development, the United Nations and ACTC are carrying out complementary activities in a number of areas of common interest. These activities must be strengthened and better coordinated for the benefit of the countries members of ACTC and, by extension, all States Members of the United Nations. To this end, close and regular working relations between the two organizations are advisable. APPENDIX Draft resolution Cooperation between the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation The General Assembly , Recalling its resolution 33/18 of 10 November 1978, by which it granted observer status to the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation, Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve cooperation in solving international problems, in particular those of an economic, social and cultural character, Further recalling that the Charter of the United Nations provides for the establishment of regional arrangements or agencies whose objectives and activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, Noting with appreciation the desire expressed by the Heads of State and Government of the French-speaking countries at their Fifth Summit, held at Grand-Baie, Mauritius, from 16 to 18 October 1993, to contribute actively to the solution of the major political and economic problems of todayâs world and to begin a new partnership with all the organizations that make up the United Nations family, Considering that the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation brings together a considerable number of States Members of the United Nations that use French as a common language, among which it promotes multilateral cooperation in areas of interest to the United Nations, Convinced of the need to coordinate the use of available resources to serve the common objectives of the two organizations, Affirming the need to establish cooperation, or strengthen such cooperation if it already exists, between the two organizations in areas of common interest, 1.
