the export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting that according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Assistance in mine clearance"", 1/ it is estimated that there are more than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the

reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1. Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1. Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that person’s approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2.

In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of a data message in evidence: (a) On the sole ground that it is a data message; or (b) If it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form. 2. Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor.

In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages.

The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1.

As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1. Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. PART TWO. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS CHAPTER I.
