The use of prison should be strictly limited as a measure of last resort. Prisons represent a waste of scarc e resources and human potential. The majority of prisoners who occupy them pose no actual threat to society. 2. The overcrowding in our prisons requires positive action through, inter alia, the introduction of community service. 3. Community service is in conformity with African traditions of dealing with offenders and with healing th e damage caused by crime within the community. Furthermore, it is a positive and cost-effective measure to be preferred whenever possible to a sentence of imprisonment. 4. Community service should be effectively implemented and supervised and involve a programme of work where the offender is required to carry out a number of hours of voluntary work for the benefit of the community in his or her own time. Governments, donors and civil society organizations are invited to support research, pilot schemes and other initiatives in this important area. Countries that already have community service should take into account lessons learned from elsewhere and review their own schemes accordingly. There should be promotion of community support through sensitization campaigns targeting public opinion; and the development of statistical databases to measure the effectiveness of community service. We encourage those countries that have not yet done so to develop non-custodial sentencing alternatives and to this end we commit ourselves to cooperating with, and coordinating our action through, other nationa | committees on community service, and/or interested groups, in order better to promote the scheme. We adopt the Plan of Action attached hereto.
