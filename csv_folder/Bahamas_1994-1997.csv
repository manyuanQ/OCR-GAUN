The primary purposes of CARICOM, established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas in July 1973, are the economic integration of member States; functional cooperation, including in the areas of common services and social, cultural and technological development; and the coordination of the foreign policies of member States. 4. Increasingly, CARICOM has been engaged in the deepening of the economic integration process among its member States, as well as the widening of that process. Recently, CARICOM has taken the initiative in the promotion of the Association of Caribbean States, which brings together other States and territories of the wider Caribbean. 5. The CARICOM secretariat has been making an important contribution to the enhancement of cooperation for sustainable development. It has helped to strengthen the involvement of CARICOM in and optimize the impact on the region of the work of the United Nations in such areas as poverty alleviation, job creation, human resource development, trade and economic diversification, the empowerment of women in the economic and legal fields, health development and the sustainable development of small island developing States. 6. In the political field, the CARICOM secretariat has assisted in the coordination of foreign policy positions and activities in areas of importance to member States, such as hemispheric and regional affairs, including the promotion of democracy and human rights in Haiti. CARICOM has been united and consistent in its support for the attainment of independence in Namibia and the elimination of apartheid in South Africa. 7. CARICOM shares the view that peace, security, human rights, democracy and development are interrelated. Through a closer working relationship between the CARICOM secretariat and the United Nations, the former can enhance its contribution to the elaboration and implementation of policies and programmes designed to address, in an integrated and comprehensive manner, the varied challenges facing the region and the community of nations at large. 8. A closer working relationship between both organizations in areas of mutual interest would be of benefit to CARICOM member States, as well as to the wider membership of the United Nations.

2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people
