crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven

The First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Manila, the Philippines, in June 1988. Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E. Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3. The Conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the exchange of experiences initiated in Manila; it also recognized the value of democracy as an integral part of political processes for the reconciliation and development of national societies and for peace and security in the international community within a broader and comprehensive concept of security. 4. In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly , to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7.

The co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS represents an internationally coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The programme comprises the following United Nations system organizations: the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank. The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization (resolution EB93.R5) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (resolution 144EX-5. 1. 5), and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: E/1994/L.18/Rev.1 I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programme’s overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13. Funding for country-level activities will be obtained primarily through existing fund-raising mechanisms of the co-sponsors. These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/20/1994,1994_191736,Costa Rica,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.

made by national and international non-governmental organizations, in particular organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,

Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons suffering from economic, social or legal disadvantage heightens their vulnerability to the risk of HIV infection, Noting that, according to a report submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses the risk of transmission of HIV, Concerned at evidence indicating that groups in society suffering discrimination in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and disadvantage with respect to their access to education, health care and social services, are as a result more vulnerable to the risk of infection and to the personal and social impact of the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social welfare which deny people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, as well as high-risk groups, enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms, Concerned that the fear and ignorance surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there is no public health rationale for any measures that limit the rights of the individual, notably measures establishing mandatory screening, Stressing that discrimination and stigmatization are counter-productive to measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, and that anti-discrimination measures form a component part of an effective public health strategy, Emphasizing the responsibility of Governments to take measures to counter social stigmatization of and discrimination against those affected by HIV/AIDS, and their commitment to strengthen national and international mechanisms that are concerned with HIV/AIDS-related human rights and ethics, Recognizing that HIV transmission can be prevented through informed and responsible behaviour, and emphasizing the role and responsibility

the context of HIV/AIDS, 1. Confirms that discrimination on the basis of AIDS or HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that the term ""or other status"" in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts can be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS; 2. Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3. Also calls upon all States to take all the necessary steps, including appropriate and speedy redress procedures and the introduction of protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimination, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people presumed to be at risk of infection, with particular attention to women, children and vulnerable groups, and to address such concerns within their activities in the context of the International Year of Tolerance, 1995; 4, Further calls upon all States to strengthen their efforts to advance the legal, economic and social status of women, children and vulnerable groups in order to render them less vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the adverse socio-economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic; 5.

THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM The reorganization of the Central American integration process resulted in the Tegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American States (OCAS), a/ signed on 13 December 199","1. This Protocol established the Central American Integration System (SICA), which began operations on 1 February 1993. The new vision of Central American development sees SICA as the regional organization best equipped to meet current needs, since its objectives and principles reflect political, social, economic and cultural conditions in the Central American countries, as well as the traditions and deepest aspirations of their peoples. Moreover, SICA was designed on the basis of past experience in terms of economic integration and the crisis of the 1980s, the peace process which has the support of the Central American people and the changes introduced in national constitutions with a view to fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, as well as the comprehensive development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. b/ This new regional situation, epitomized by SICA, is that of a more open, stable and democratic Central America. More open, because in addition to reaffirming our ties with the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), we have devised mechanisms and strategies for broadening and intensifying the region’s participation in the international arena. More stable, because we now have definite, clearly formulated objectives and principles to steer the course of regional action and of political thinking and decision-making in Central America. These objectives and principles are spelled out in the Tegucigalpa Protocol to guide the search for ways to ensure the overall well-being and sustainable development of Central Americans; they include the goal of fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, whose security will be based primarily on the strengthening of civilian government, the elimination of extreme poverty, the promotion of sustained development, protection of the environment and the eradication of corruption, violence, terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms. To achieve that objective, the fundamental and legitimate basis for all regional actions must be protection of, respect for and promotion of human rights. Without that underpinning, the legal and political structure of SICA would have no foundation or purpose. With the institution of SICA, integration is no longer sectoral — that is, commercial and economic — but comprehensive, meaning that it extends to the economic, social, cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development. Consequently, SICA comprises four sub-systems: economic, social, cultural and political. Environmental conservation and the building of a new ecological order in the region is another objective of the System and constitutes the basic pillar of the comprehensive human development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. Thus, the general coordination of all of these sub-systems is the linchpin of integration efforts, and has been entrusted to the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and, on an ongoing basis, to the General Secretariat of SICA. These bodies follow up on regional decisions and policies, prepare documentation for political decision-making and ensure the proper observance and implementation of the Tegucigalpa Protocol. The immediate objective of this overall coordination, which is carried out jointly and with due respect for each sub-system’s functional autonomy, is to guarantee development, as well as unity and coherence in Central American intraregional activities and in relations with third States, groups of States and international organizations. The Meeting of Central American Presidents is the supreme organ of SICA with respect to decisions concerning development, freedom, peace and security. These decisions are followed up by the Councils of Ministers and the General Secretariat, which is also the Permanent Secretariat of the Meeting of Central American Presidents, and by the specialized technical secretariats, with the support of the integration institutions of the different sub-systems. The Meeting of Vice-Presidents acts as an advisory and consultancy organ for the Meeting of Presidents. Another main body is the Central American Parliament, which acts as an organ for exposition, analysis and recommendation under its Constituent Treaty. In order to institute legal safeguards to preserve the rule of law in the region, the Central American Court of Justice was established to guarantee respect for the Tegucigalpa Protocol and its supplementary instruments and acts pursuant to it. The Court is the main judicial organ of SICA. To strengthen the chances of success of regional action by making it consistent, lasting and reliable and by responding to the deeply felt needs and fully recognized aspirations of Central Americans, SICA has a Consultative Committee which provides a forum for the democratic and institutional participation of the community, at the level of private or non-governmental institutions organized regionally in Central America. Regarding the significance of SICA, on 15 June 1994, in their joint declaration to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, the Presidents of the Central American States said the following: Thanks to the will of its peoples and Governments, Central America has established a firm and lasting peace based upon dialogue, democracy, justice and reconciliation. Thus, it has overcome a crisis which originated in the region itself, but was exacerbated by the cold war and the confrontation between the super-Powers. The fruits of that effort can now be seen in improved levels of stability and in the creation and implementation of the Central American Integration System (SICA), accompanied by the consolidation of democratic institutions born of the free expression of the will of the people in fair and open elections. This auspicious situation places Central America in an exceptional position among those regions of the world which have, during the past 10 years, gone through a difficult process of democratic transition. It also enables our region to move forward from an agenda for peace towards an agenda for sustainable human development, which is the main objective that our peoples must pursue in the interests of guaranteeing continued progress. This position was reiterated at the fifteenth Meeting of Presidents of Central America, in Guacimo, Costa Rica, on 20 August 1994 when they stated that: c/ ""Central America has changed. In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement, Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region; democracies have been established and transformed; respect for human rights has been strengthened, and the new regional integration system has been defined."" II. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND ITS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION SICA enjoys international recognition. As an example, at their meeting in Brazil, on 15 and 16 July 1993, the Ibero-American Heads of State and Government stated: d/ ""We recognize the importance of the entry into force, on 1 February 1993, of the Central American Integration System (SICA), under the Tegucigalpa Protocol, whose main objective is to establish Central America as a region of democracy, development, peace and freedom, based principally on the respect, safeguard and promotion of human rights. We exhort the States and international organizations involved to cooperate effectively so that SICA promotes and strengthens the subregional integration of Central America and achieves its basic aim."" For its part, on 10 June 1994, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution (AG/Doc.3157/94), welcoming the signing of the Cooperation Agreement between the General Secretariat of the Organization and the General Secretariat of SICA and calling for the establishment of a programme of cooperation between the two organizations. On 20 September 1994 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recognized SICA as an entity having consultative status. III. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND THE UNITED NATIONS SICA is the successor to OCAS, which was established by the Charter of San Salvador, signed on 12 December 1962 by five Central American States. As such, it is also a regional arrangement within the meaning of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Its influence also extends into the field of activity covered in Chapter IX (Articles 55 and 56). The relationship between the United Nations and SICA is one of complementarity, since the United Nations is an organization of a universal nature and SICA is a subregional integration organization one of whose basic principles is respect for the principles and norms of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations will strengthen the realization of its aims and purposes at the international level by effectively coordinating its world-wide activities with those of subregional organizations, in this case, with SICA. The participation of SICA as an observer in the General Assembly of the United Nations will help the subregional organization reaffirm and consolidate Central American self-determination in external affairs, through a common strategy which will strengthen the participation of the region as a whole in the international field. In its resolution 49/137 of 19 December 1994, entitled ""The situation in Central America: Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development"", the General Assembly declared that it was aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments for the consolidation of a firm peace in Central America, and that the Central American Integration System constituted the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development could be promoted in an effective, orderly and coherent manner. It went on to emphasize the functioning of the Central American Integration System since 1 February 1993 and the registry of the Tegucigalpa Protocol with the United Nations Secretariat, expressed its full support for the efforts made by the Central Americans to stimulate and broaden the integration process in the context of the Central American Integration System, and called on Member States and international organizations to provide effective cooperation to Central America so that it might steadily promote and strengthen subregional integration and achieve its fundamental goal (resolution 49/137, preamble and para. 5). Resolution 48/161 of 20 December 1993, adopted by the Assembly at its forty- eighth session, referred to SICA in the same terms. Notes A/46/829-S/23310, annex III.

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1. Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2.

CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1. In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages. Where a data message is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that purpose. 2. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1. As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, a declaration of will or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. A/C.6/51/L.8 that of the originator if it was sent: (a) By a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or (b) By an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically. 3. As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1. Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt.

question, Considering that the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the basic purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and one of the main priorities of the Organization, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 2 Recalling that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of strengthening the Centre for Human Rights, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/116), as well as of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/103), Recalling the note by the Secretary-General on the geographical composition and functions of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights (A/50/682), Taking into account that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights

budgets of the United Nations, and to take urgent steps to seek increased extrabudgetary resources, Taking into account also the establishment of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human

General Assembly in that resolution for appropriate staff and resources to enable the High Commissioner to fulfil his mandate, Noting with concern that the response to this request has not been commensurate with the needs, resulting in a serious and increasing imbalance between the mandates assigned to the High Commissioner and to the Centre by the competent bodies of the United Nations system in the field of human rights and the resources available to fulfil those mandates, Taking into account the fact that the responsibilities of the High Commissioner include, inter alia, engaging in a dialogue with all Governments in the implementation of his mandate with a view to the promotion and protection of all human rights, and rationalizing, adapting, strengthening and streamlining the United Nations machinery in the field of human rights with a view to improving its efficiency and effectiveness, Mindful of situations in which rapid action by the High Commissioner for Human Rights

through cooperation within the United Nations system, inter alia, through the use of its established procedures of existing mechanisms, Noting that the difficult financial situation of the United Nations human rights programme has created considerable obstacles in implementing in full and on time the various procedures and mechanisms, Noting also that the High Commissioner and the Centre are a unity whereby the High Commissioner, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141, sets the policy directions and the priority of action and the Centre implements those policies under the direction of the head of the Centre, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Emphasizing that, while further improvement in the function and efficiency of the Centre, together with a strong emphasis on good management practices, is needed in order to enable the Centre to cope with its constantly increasing workload, good management practices need to be complemented by resources commensurate with mandates, Taking note of the information provided by the High Commissioner with regard to the ongoing process aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre, and encouraging the High Commissioner to continue to inform Member States on his efforts in a similar manner, inter alia through briefing sessions, Recognizing that this process should contribute to the strengthening of the functional framework for integrated and consolidated activities of the Secretariat in the field of human rights, while reaffirming full respect for the mandates given to the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Centre by the appropriate intergovernmental bodies, Recalling that in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that the paramount consideration in the employment of staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and that it was convinced that that was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution, and bearing in mind Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page

Adopts the text of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings annexed to the present resolution and opens the instrument for signing at United Nations Headquarters from 12 January 1998 until 31 December 1999; 2. Urges all States to sign and ratify, accept or approve or to accede to the annexed Convention.

Considering that the occurrence of such acts is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole, Noting that the activities of military forces of States are governed by rules of international law outside the framework of this Convention and that the exclusion of certain actions from the coverage of this Convention does not condone or make lawful otherwise unlawful acts, or preclude prosecution under other laws, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 For the purposes of this Convention: 1. ""State or government facility"" includes any permanent or temporary facility or conveyance that is used or occupied by representatives of a State, members of Government, the legislature or the judiciary or by officials or employees of a State or any other public authority or entity or by employees or officials of an intergovernmental organization in connection with their official duties. 2.

Article 3 This Convention shall not apply where the offence is committed within a single State, the alleged offender and the victims are nationals of that State, the alleged offender is found in the territory of that State and no other State has a basis under article 6, paragraph 1, or article 6, paragraph 2, of this Convention to exercise jurisdiction, except that the provisions of articles 10 to 15 shall, as appropriate, apply in those cases. Article 4 Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary: (a) To establish as criminal offences under its domestic law the offences set forth in article 2 of this Convention; (b) To make those offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of those offences. Article 5 Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary, including, where appropriate, domestic legislation, to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention, in particular where they are intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature. Article 6 1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 2 when: (a) The offence is committed in the territory of that State; or (b) The offence is committed on board a vessel flying the flag of that State or an aircraft which is registered under the laws of that State at the time the offence is committed; or (c) The offence is committed by a national of that State. 2.

Upon ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to this Convention, each State Party shall notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the jurisdiction it has established in accordance with paragraph 2 under its domestic law. Should any change take place, the State Party concerned shall immediately notify the Secretary-General. 4, Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 2 in cases where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite that person to any of the States Parties which have established their jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2. 5. This Convention does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a State Party in accordance with its domestic law. Article 7 1. Upon receiving information that a person who has committed or who is alleged to have committed an offence as set forth in article 2 may be present in its territory, the State Party concerned shall take such measures as may be necessary under its domestic law to investigate the facts contained in the information. 2. Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, the State Party in whose territory the offender or alleged offender is present shall take the appropriate measures under its domestic law so as to ensure that person's presence for the purpose of prosecution or extradition. 3. Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 2 are being taken shall be entitled to: (a) Communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which that person is a national or which is otherwise entitled to protect that person's rights or, if that person is a stateless person, the State in the territory of which that person habitually resides; (b) Be visited by a representative of that State; (c) Be informed of that person's rights under subparagraphs (a) and (b). 4. The rights referred to in paragraph 3 shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the State in the territory of which the offender or alleged offender is present, subject to the provision that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under paragraph 3 are intended. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be without prejudice to the right of any State Party having a claim to jurisdiction in accordance with article 6, subparagraph 1 (c) or 2 (c), to invite the International Committee of the Red Cross to communicate with and visit the alleged offender. 6. When a State Party, pursuant to this article, has taken a person into custody, it shall immediately notify, directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the States Parties which have established jurisdiction in Jaee accordance with article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, and, if it considers it advisable, any other interested States Parties, of the fact that such person is in custody and of the circumstances which warrant that person's detention. The State which makes the investigation contemplated in paragraph 1 shall promptly inform the said States Parties of its findings and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction. Article 8 1. The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall, in cases to which article 6 applies, if it does not extradite that person, be obliged, without exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the law of that State. 2. Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1. Article 9 1. The offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them. 2. When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested State Party may, at its option, consider this Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State. 3. States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 2 as extraditable offences between themselves, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State. 4. If necessary, the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated, for the purposes of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the Jaee States that have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2. 5. The provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements between States Parties with regard to offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modified as between State Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention. Article 10 1. States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 2, including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings. 2. States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrangements, States Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their domestic law. Article 11 None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded, for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance, as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives. Article 12 Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance, if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons. Article 13 1. A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony, identification or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the investigation or prosecution of offences under this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met: (a) The person freely gives his or her informed consent; and (b) The competent authorities of both States agree, subject to such conditions as those States may deem appropriate. 2. For the purposes of this article: (a) The State to which the person is transferred shall have the authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody, unless otherwise requested or authorized by the State from which the person was transferred; (b) The State to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand, or as otherwise agreed, by the competent authorities of both States; (c) The State to which the person is transferred shall not require the State from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings for the return of the person; (d) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State from which he was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State to which he was transferred. 3. Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in accordance with this article so agrees, that person, whatever his or her nationality, shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts or convictions anterior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from which such person was transferred. Article 14 Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair treatment, including enjoyment of all rights and guarantees in conformity with the law of the State in the territory of which that person is present and applicable provisions of international law, including international law of human rights. Article 15 States Parties shall cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2, particularly: (a) By taking all practicable measures, including, if necessary, adapting their domestic legislation, to prevent and counter preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories, including measures to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations that encourage, instigate, organize, knowingly finance or engage in the perpetration of offences as set forth in article 2; (b) By exchanging accurate and verified information in accordance with their national law, and coordinating administrative and other measures taken as appropriate to prevent the commission of offences as set forth in article 2; (c) Where appropriate, through research and development regarding methods of detection of explosives and other harmful substances that can cause death or bodily injury, consultations on the development of standards for marking explosives in order to identify their origin in post-blast investigations, exchange of information on preventive measures, cooperation and transfer of technology, equipment and related materials. Article 16 The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall, in accordance with its domestic law or applicable procedures, communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit the information to the other States Parties. Article 17 The States Parties shall carry out their obligations under this Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. Article 18 Nothing in this Convention entitles a State Party to undertake in the territory of another State Party the exercise of jurisdiction and performance of functions which are exclusively reserved for the authorities of that other State Party by its domestic law. Article 19 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law. 2. The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention. Article 20 1. Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which cannot be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If, within six months from the date of the request for arbitration, the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice, by application, in conformity with the Statute of the Court. 2. Each State may at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or accession thereto declare that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1. The other States Parties shall not be bound by paragraph 1 with respect to any State Party which has made such a reservation. 3. Any State which has made a reservation in accordance with paragraph 2 may at any time withdraw that reservation by notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Article 21 1. This Convention shall be open for signature by all States from 12 January 1998 until 31 December 1999 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. 2. This Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval. The instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 3. This Convention shall be open to accession by any State. The instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Article 22 1. This Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day following the date of the deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 2. For each State ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to the Convention after the deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, the Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after deposit by such State of its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. Article 23 1. Any State Party may denounce this Convention by written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 2. Denunciation shall take effect one year following the date on which notification is received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
