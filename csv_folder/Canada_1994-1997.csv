Regrets the failure of the Government of Iraq to provide satisfactory replies concerning the violations of human rights brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, and calls upon the Government to reply without delay in a comprehensive and detailed manner so as to enable the Special Rapporteur to formulate the appropriate recommendations to improve the situation of human rights in Iraq; 12.

We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Only in this way can we prevent new tragedies and ensure that all nations become a community living in peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity.",10/11/1995,1995_199817,Canada,1/ Resolution 217 A (III).,yes

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the

twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or

prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference

and insisted that Iraq cooperate with humanitarian organizations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens were respected, Recalling also Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) of 15 August 1991, 712 (1991) of 19 September 1991 and 778 (1992) of 2 October 1992, Recalling in particular its resolution 1991/74 of 6 March 1991, in which the Commission requested its

of 1961, Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to address the illicit drug problem, Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Stressing that respect for human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem, Emphasizing the need for an analysis of transit routes used by drug traffickers, which are constantly changing and expanding to include a

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1. Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1. Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that personâs approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the absence of a signature. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 8 Original 1. Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in its original form, that requirement is met by a data message if: (a) There exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as a data message or otherwise; and (b) Where it is required that information be presented, that information is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to be presented. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being presented or retained in its original form. 3. For the purposes of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1: (a) The criteria for assessing integrity shall be whether the information has remained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement and any change which arises in the normal course of communication, storage and display; and (b) The standard of reliability required shall be assessed in the light of the purpose for which the information was generated and in the light of all the relevant circumstances. 4. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 9 Admissibility and evidential weight of data messages 1. In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of a data message in evidence: (a) On the sole ground that it is a data message; or (b) If it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form. 2. Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor. A/C.6/51/L.8 retained, that requirement is met by retaining data messages, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: (a) The information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference; and (b) The data message is retained in the format in which it was generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately the information generated, sent or received; and (c) Such information, if any, is retained as enables the identification of the origin and destination of a data message and the date and time when it was sent or received. 2. An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with paragraph 1 does not extend to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the message to be sent or received. 3. A person may satisfy the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 by using the services of any other person, provided that the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 are met. CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1. In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages. Where a data message is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that purpose. 2. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1. As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, a declaration of will or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. A/C.6/51/L.8 that of the originator if it was sent: (a) By a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or (b) By an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically. 3. As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1. Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addresseeâs acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. PART TWO. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS CHAPTER I.

of refugees and other displaced persons and for the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, Conscious. of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors, which may include human rights violations, political, ethnic and economic conflicts, famine, insecurity, violence, poverty and environmental degradation, which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system-wide response, particularly at the international and regional levels, Noting that the Secretary-General, in

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, aimed at making effective the fundamental right of refugees to return to their own countries in safety and dignity, Recognizing that the

preventing mass exoduses and to strengthening emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, should be encouraged and further developed and coordinated at the international, regional and country

Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for completing and adopting the Model law on Cross- Border Insolvency contained in the annex to the present resolution; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Model Law, together with the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law prepared by the Secretariat, to Governments and other interested bodies; 3. Recommends that all States review their legislation on cross-border aspects of insolvency to determine whether the legislation meets the objectives of a modern and efficient insolvency system and, in that review, give favourable consideration to the Model Law, bearing in mind the need for an internationally harmonized legislation governing instances of cross-border insolvency; 4. Recommends also that all efforts be made to ensure that the Model Law, together with the Guide, become generally known and available. ANNEX Model _Law_on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law PREAMBLE The purpose of this Law is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of: (a) Cooperation between the courts and other competent authorities of this State and foreign States involved in cases of cross-border insolvency; (b) Greater legal certainty for trade and investment; (c) Fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested persons, including the debtor; (d) Protection and maximization of the value of the debtor's assets; and (e) Facilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.
