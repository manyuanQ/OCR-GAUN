A/49/234 English Page 2 ANNEX Explanatory memorandum Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has shown a continuing interest in the study of the question of capital punishment, with a view to promoting full respect for everyoneâs right to life, and has taken various initiatives aiming at reaching the ultimate goal of abolishing the death penalty in all countries. Among these is","General Assembly resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which the Assembly adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The question of capital punishment has become particularly urgent in recent times, in view of the continuing high number of death sentences and executions in various parts of the world. On 4 October 1994, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution in which it underlined this urgency and asked all States that had not yet abolished capital punishment to do so rapidly. We also would like to recall the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 March 1992 pointing in the same direction. In accordance with such a line, our countries have decided to promote appropriate action within the United Nations, aiming at contributing to an eventual abolition of capital punishment. This initiative reflects the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of our peoples, who are firmly opposed to the imposition of the death penalty anywhere in the world. Therefore, we would like to request the inclusion of the question of capital punishment in the agenda of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, and to this end submit the attached resolution. In our view, the Third Committee is the most appropriate forum in which to consider the question of capital punishment. We therefore recommend that the proposed item be assigned to the Third Committee. APPENDIX Draft resolution The General Assembly , Recalling article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms everyoneâs right to life, Recalling its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971 and 32/61 of 8 December 1977, as well as resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which it adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolutions 1574 (L) of 20 May 1971, 1745 (LIV) of 16 May 1973, 1930 (LVIII) of 6 May 1975, 1985/33 of 29 May 1985, 1990/29 of 24 May 1990 and 1990/51 of 24 July 1990, Deeply concerned about the fact that capital punishment is still retained and used for ordinary crimes by a consistent number of Member States and that several countries impose the death penalty in disregard of the safeguards provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for juveniles and pregnant women, Commending the fact that both in the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, established by the Security Council in its resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, and in the statute for an international criminal court, elaborated by the International Law Commission, capital punishment is excluded from the penalties that these courts are authorized to impose, Believing that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights, 1. Calls upon all Governments in a position to do so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Invites all States, referring to its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) and 32/61, to consider the progressive restriction of the number of offences for which the death penalty may be imposed and the exclusion of juveniles and pregnant women from capital executions; 3.

Also encourages all States to consider the opportunity of instituting moratoria on pending executions, with a view to ensuring that the principle that no State should dispose of the life of any human being is affirmed in every part of the world by the year 2000.",10/25/1994,1994_163939,Honduras,"@) General Assembly oiste, ââ 3GENERALA/49/234 25 October 1994ORIGINAL: ENGLISHForty-ninth sessionREQUEST FOR THE INCLUSION OF AN ADDITIONAL ITEM IN THE AGENDA OF THE FORTY-NINTH SESSIONCAPITAL PUNISHMENTLetter dated 21 October 1994 from the Permanent",yes

crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing

In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6.

Moreover, SICA was designed on the basis of past experience in terms of economic integration and the crisis of the 1980s, the peace process which has the support of the Central American people and the changes introduced in national constitutions with a view to fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, as well as the comprehensive development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. b/ This new regional situation, epitomized by SICA, is that of a more open, stable and democratic Central America. More open, because in addition to reaffirming our ties with the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), we have devised mechanisms and strategies for broadening and intensifying the regionâs participation in the international arena. More stable, because we now have definite, clearly formulated objectives and principles to steer the course of regional action and of political thinking and decision-making in Central America. These objectives and principles are spelled out in the Tegucigalpa Protocol to guide the search for ways to ensure the overall well-being and sustainable development of Central Americans; they include the goal of fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, whose security will be based primarily on the strengthening of civilian government, the elimination of extreme poverty, the promotion of sustained development, protection of the environment and the eradication of corruption, violence, terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms. To achieve that objective, the fundamental and legitimate basis for all regional actions must be protection of, respect for and promotion of human rights. Without that underpinning, the legal and political structure of SICA would have no foundation or purpose. With the institution of SICA, integration is no longer sectoral â that is, commercial and economic â but comprehensive, meaning that it extends to the economic, social, cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development. Consequently, SICA comprises four sub-systems: economic, social, cultural and political. Environmental conservation and the building of a new ecological order in the region is another objective of the System and constitutes the basic pillar of the comprehensive human development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. Thus, the general coordination of all of these sub-systems is the linchpin of integration efforts, and has been entrusted to the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and, on an ongoing basis, to the General Secretariat of SICA. These bodies follow up on regional decisions and policies, prepare documentation for political decision-making and ensure the proper observance and implementation of the Tegucigalpa Protocol. The immediate objective of this overall coordination, which is carried out jointly and with due respect for each sub-systemâs functional autonomy, is to guarantee development, as well as unity and coherence in Central American intraregional activities and in relations with third States, groups of States and international organizations. The Meeting of Central American Presidents is the supreme organ of SICA with respect to decisions concerning development, freedom, peace and security. These decisions are followed up by the Councils of Ministers and the General Secretariat, which is also the Permanent Secretariat of the Meeting of Central American Presidents, and by the specialized technical secretariats, with the support of the integration institutions of the different sub-systems. The Meeting of Vice-Presidents acts as an advisory and consultancy organ for the Meeting of Presidents. Another main body is the Central American Parliament, which acts as an organ for exposition, analysis and recommendation under its Constituent Treaty. In order to institute legal safeguards to preserve the rule of law in the region, the Central American Court of Justice was established to guarantee respect for the Tegucigalpa Protocol and its supplementary instruments and acts pursuant to it. The Court is the main judicial organ of SICA. To strengthen the chances of success of regional action by making it consistent, lasting and reliable and by responding to the deeply felt needs and fully recognized aspirations of Central Americans, SICA has a Consultative Committee which provides a forum for the democratic and institutional participation of the community, at the level of private or non-governmental institutions organized regionally in Central America. Regarding the significance of SICA, on 15 June 1994, in their joint declaration to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, the Presidents of the Central American States said the following: Thanks to the will of its peoples and Governments, Central America has established a firm and lasting peace based upon dialogue, democracy, justice and reconciliation. Thus, it has overcome a crisis which originated in the region itself, but was exacerbated by the cold war and the confrontation between the super-Powers. The fruits of that effort can now be seen in improved levels of stability and in the creation and implementation of the Central American Integration System (SICA), accompanied by the consolidation of democratic institutions born of the free expression of the will of the people in fair and open elections. This auspicious situation places Central America in an exceptional position among those regions of the world which have, during the past 10 years, gone through a difficult process of democratic transition. It also enables our region to move forward from an agenda for peace towards an agenda for sustainable human development, which is the main objective that our peoples must pursue in the interests of guaranteeing continued progress. This position was reiterated at the fifteenth Meeting of Presidents of Central America, in Guacimo, Costa Rica, on 20 August 1994 when they stated that: c/ ""Central America has changed. In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement, Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region; democracies have been established and transformed; respect for human rights has been strengthened, and the new regional integration system has been defined."" II. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND ITS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION SICA enjoys international recognition. As an example, at their meeting in Brazil, on 15 and 16 July 1993, the Ibero-American Heads of State and Government stated: d/ ""We recognize the importance of the entry into force, on 1 February 1993, of the Central American Integration System (SICA), under the Tegucigalpa Protocol, whose main objective is to establish Central America as a region of democracy, development, peace and freedom, based principally on the respect, safeguard and promotion of human rights. We exhort the States and international organizations involved to cooperate effectively so that SICA promotes and strengthens the subregional integration of Central America and achieves its basic aim."" For its part, on 10 June 1994, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution (AG/Doc.3157/94), welcoming the signing of the Cooperation Agreement between the General Secretariat of the Organization and the General Secretariat of SICA and calling for the establishment of a programme of cooperation between the two organizations. On 20 September 1994 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recognized SICA as an entity having consultative status. III. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND THE UNITED NATIONS SICA is the successor to OCAS, which was established by the Charter of San Salvador, signed on 12 December 1962 by five Central American States. As such, it is also a regional arrangement within the meaning of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Its influence also extends into the field of activity covered in Chapter IX (Articles 55 and 56). The relationship between the United Nations and SICA is one of complementarity, since the United Nations is an organization of a universal nature and SICA is a subregional integration organization one of whose basic principles is respect for the principles and norms of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations will strengthen the realization of its aims and purposes at the international level by effectively coordinating its world-wide activities with those of subregional organizations, in this case, with SICA. The participation of SICA as an observer in the General Assembly of the United Nations will help the subregional organization reaffirm and consolidate Central American self-determination in external affairs, through a common strategy which will strengthen the participation of the region as a whole in the international field. In its resolution 49/137 of 19 December 1994, entitled ""The situation in Central America: Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development"", the General Assembly declared that it was aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments for the consolidation of a firm peace in Central America, and that the Central American Integration System constituted the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development could be promoted in an effective, orderly and coherent manner. It went on to emphasize the functioning of the Central American Integration System since 1 February 1993 and the registry of the Tegucigalpa Protocol with the United Nations Secretariat, expressed its full support for the efforts made by the Central Americans to stimulate and broaden the integration process in the context of the Central American Integration System, and called on Member States and international organizations to provide effective cooperation to Central America so that it might steadily promote and strengthen subregional integration and achieve its fundamental goal (resolution 49/137, preamble and para. 5). Resolution 48/161 of 20 December 1993, adopted by the Assembly at its forty- eighth session, referred to SICA in the same terms. Notes A/46/829-S/23310, annex III.

In this World Year of Peopleâs Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression. 3. We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Only in this way can we prevent new tragedies and ensure that all nations become a community living in peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity.",10/11/1995,1995_199817,Honduras,1/ Resolution 217 A (III).,yes
