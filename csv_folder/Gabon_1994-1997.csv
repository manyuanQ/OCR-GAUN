The co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS represents an internationally coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The programme comprises the following United Nations system organizations: the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank. The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization (resolution EB93.R5) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (resolution 144EX-5. 1. 5), and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: E/1994/L.18/Rev.1 I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13. Funding for country-level activities will be obtained primarily through existing fund-raising mechanisms of the co-sponsors. These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/20/1994,1994_191736,Gabon,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.
