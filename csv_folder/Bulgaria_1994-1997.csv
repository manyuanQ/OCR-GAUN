crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing

Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons

at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of

the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social

surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there

in the context of HIV/AIDS (E/CN.4/1995/45) and his recommendations therein, but noting with concern that there is insufficient information about successful strategies for protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, 1. Confirms that discrimination on the basis of AIDS or HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that the term ""or other status"" in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts can be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS; 2. Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3. Also calls upon all States to take all the necessary steps, including appropriate and speedy redress procedures and the introduction of protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimination, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people presumed to be at risk of infection, with particular attention to women, children and vulnerable groups, and to address such concerns within their activities in the context of the International Year of Tolerance, 1995; 4, Further calls upon all States to strengthen their efforts to advance the legal, economic and social status of women, children and vulnerable groups in order to render them less vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the adverse socio-economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic; 5.

once again the right of all its victims to return to their homes in safety and dignity, the invalidity of forcible territorial gains and of forced transfers of property and other acts under duress,

and of all those involved in the humanitarian relief effort, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the officers

resolution to the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, and supporting the continuing efforts of all who seek to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Welcoming especially in this regard the efforts of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, its Co-Chairmen and Steering Committee, Welcoming in particular the efforts undertaken by representatives of the international community to assist the parties in reaching a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to achieve a cease-fire, the signature of an economic agreement and the eventual resolution of the political situation in Croatia, as well as the role played by the United Nations Protection Force under very difficult circumstances, the activities of the European Commission Monitoring Mission and the European Union administration of Mostar, the constitutional provisions for the protection of human rights and other aspects of the Federation agreements of Washington and Vienna, and other proposals which could, if accepted by all parties, lead to a substantial improvement in the human rights situation of members of all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Welcoming in this regard the signature of the comprehensive cease-fire agreement on 23 December 1994, in which the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities agreed to protect the human rights of those persons residing within the territory under their control in accordance with international standards, to prompt and unconditional release of all detainees, including prisoners of war, and to release all available information on missing persons, and of the Agreement on Complete Cessation of

Reaffirms the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to find peaceful solutions through negotiations and fully to protect human rights at all times; 4.

Demands immediate, firm and resolute action by the international community to stop all human rights violations, to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to bring those responsible to trial; 6.

Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver umanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 10. Renews its expression of outrage at the use of the systematic practice of rape as a weapon of war against women and children and as an instrument of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the areas of armed conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and again recognizes that rape in these circumstances constitutes a war crime; 12.

Again demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, recalling that the best means to prevent the possible escalation of the conflict is to safeguard human rights, restore genuine autonomy and establish democratic institutions in Kosovo; 25. Expresses its grave concern at renewed reports of violations of human rights in Sandjak and in Vojvodina and concerning members of the Bulgarian minority, as noted by the Special Rapporteur, while commending the courage and sacrifice of many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 8 26. Urges all parties in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, to engage in a substantive dialogue, under the auspices of, among others, the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, to act with the utmost restraint and to settle disputes peacefully and with full respect for human rights; 27.

(E) 121095 121095 Joes 2. In this World Year of Peopleâs Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression. 3. We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Only in this way can we prevent new tragedies and ensure that all nations become a community living in peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity.",10/11/1995,1995_199817,Bulgaria,1/ Resolution 217 A (III).,yes

which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons, Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the

""intolerable situation caused by the proliferation of anti-personnel land-mines throughout the world"", Recalling with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General concerning progress on the initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 2/ Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land- mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to

Paragraph 1 does not affect any right that may exist to modify by agreement any rule of law referred to in chapter II. CHAPTER II. APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1. Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1. Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that personâs approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the absence of a signature. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 8 Original 1. Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in its original form, that requirement is met by a data message if: (a) There exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as a data message or otherwise; and (b) Where it is required that information be presented, that information is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to be presented. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being presented or retained in its original form. 3. For the purposes of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1: (a) The criteria for assessing integrity shall be whether the information has remained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement and any change which arises in the normal course of communication, storage and display; and (b) The standard of reliability required shall be assessed in the light of the purpose for which the information was generated and in the light of all the relevant circumstances. 4. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 9 Admissibility and evidential weight of data messages 1. In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of a data message in evidence: (a) On the sole ground that it is a data message; or (b) If it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form. 2. Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor. A/C.6/51/L.8 retained, that requirement is met by retaining data messages, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: (a) The information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference; and (b) The data message is retained in the format in which it was generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately the information generated, sent or received; and (c) Such information, if any, is retained as enables the identification of the origin and destination of a data message and the date and time when it was sent or received. 2. An obligation to retain documents, records or information in accordance with paragraph 1 does not extend to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the message to be sent or received. 3. A person may satisfy the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 by using the services of any other person, provided that the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 are met. CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1. In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages. Where a data message is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that purpose. 2. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1. As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, a declaration of will or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. A/C.6/51/L.8 that of the originator if it was sent: (a) By a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or (b) By an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically. 3. As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1. Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addresseeâs acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. PART TWO. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS CHAPTER I.

question, Considering that the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the basic purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and one of the main priorities of the Organization, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 2 Recalling that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of strengthening the Centre for Human Rights, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/116), as well as of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/103), Recalling the note by the Secretary-General on the geographical composition and functions of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights (A/50/682), Taking into account that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to take immediate steps to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations, and to take urgent steps to seek increased extrabudgetary resources, Taking into account also the establishment of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the mandate for the post, as defined in General Assembly resolution 48/141, including its coordinating role and its overall supervision of the Centre, as well as the request by the General Assembly in that resolution for appropriate staff and resources to enable the High Commissioner to fulfil his mandate, Noting with concern that the response to this request has not been commensurate with the needs, resulting in a serious and increasing imbalance between the mandates assigned to the High Commissioner and to the Centre by the competent bodies of the United Nations system in the field of human rights and the resources available to fulfil those mandates, Taking into account the fact that the responsibilities of the High Commissioner include, inter alia, engaging in a dialogue with all Governments in the implementation of his mandate with a view to the promotion and protection of all human rights, and rationalizing, adapting, strengthening and streamlining the United Nations machinery in the field of human rights with a view to improving its efficiency and effectiveness, Mindful of situations in which rapid action by the High Commissioner for Human Rights is required in order to address urgent crises in the field of human rights, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 3 Aware that the effectiveness of action by the High Commissioner for Human Rights could be enhanced through cooperation within the United Nations system, inter alia, through the use of its established procedures of existing mechanisms, Noting that the difficult financial situation of the United Nations human rights programme has created considerable obstacles in implementing in full and on time the various procedures and mechanisms, Noting also that the High Commissioner and the Centre are a unity whereby the High Commissioner, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141, sets the policy directions and the priority of action and the Centre implements those policies under the direction of the head of the Centre, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Emphasizing that, while further improvement in the function and efficiency of the Centre, together with a strong emphasis on good management practices, is needed in order to enable the Centre to cope with its constantly increasing workload, good management practices need to be complemented by resources commensurate with mandates, Taking note of the information provided by the High Commissioner with regard to the ongoing process aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre, and encouraging the High Commissioner to continue to inform Member States on his efforts in a similar manner, inter alia through briefing sessions, Recognizing that this process should contribute to the strengthening of the functional framework for integrated and consolidated activities of the Secretariat in the field of human rights, while reaffirming full respect for the mandates given to the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Centre by the appropriate intergovernmental bodies, Recalling that in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that the paramount consideration in the employment of staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and that it was convinced that that was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution, and bearing in mind Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 4 1.

1997,Sixth Committee,Fifty-second session,148,REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ON THE WORK OF ITS THIRTIETH SESSION,"Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norwa Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United States of America and Venezuela",N/A,Model Law _on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,"The General Assembly , Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade, Noting that increased cross-border trade and investment leads to greater incidence of cases where enterprises and individuals have assets in more than one State, Noting also that when a debtor with assets in more than one State becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding, there often exists an urgent need for cross-border cooperation and coordination in the supervision and administration of the insolvent debtor's assets and affairs, Considering that inadequate coordination and cooperation in cases of cross- border insolvency reduce the possibility of rescuing financially troubled but viable businesses, impede a fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, make it more likely that the debtor's assets would be concealed or dissipated and hinder reorganizations or liquidations of debtors' assets and affairs that would be the most advantageous for the creditors and other interested persons, including the debtors and the debtors' employees, Noting that many States lack a legislative framework that would make possible or facilitate effective cross-border coordination and cooperation, Convinced that fair and internationally harmonized legislation on cross- border insolvency that respects the national procedural and judicial systems and is acceptable to States with different legal, social and economic systems would contribute to the development of international trade and investment, Considering that a set of internationally harmonized model legislative provisions on cross-border insolvency is needed to assist States in modernizing their legislation governing cross-border insolvency, 1.

Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Model Law, together with the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law prepared by the Secretariat, to Governments and other interested bodies; 3. Recommends that all States review their legislation on cross-border aspects of insolvency to determine whether the legislation meets the objectives of a modern and efficient insolvency system and, in that review, give favourable consideration to the Model Law, bearing in mind the need for an internationally harmonized legislation governing instances of cross-border insolvency; 4. Recommends also that all efforts be made to ensure that the Model Law, together with the Guide, become generally known and available. ANNEX Model _Law_on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law PREAMBLE The purpose of this Law is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of: (a) Cooperation between the courts and other competent authorities of this State and foreign States involved in cases of cross-border insolvency; (b) Greater legal certainty for trade and investment; (c) Fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested persons, including the debtor; (d) Protection and maximization of the value of the debtor's assets; and (e) Facilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.
