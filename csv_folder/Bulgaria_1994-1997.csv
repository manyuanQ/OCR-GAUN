crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection

individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing

Expresses its appreciation to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for the conscientiousness with which it has defined its working methods and for the way in which it carries out its task, more particularly for recalling the importance that it attaches to respect for the adversarial procedure in its dialogue with States, and to seeking the cooperation of all those concerned by the cases submitted to it for consideration; 2. Takes note with satisfaction of the Working Group's report, inter alia its point-by-point examination of the requests made in resolution 1993/36, and thanks the experts for the rigour with which they have performed their task, in the light of the very specific nature of their mandate of investigating cases; 3.

Notes with concern that, according to the Working Group, the practice of arbitrary detention is facilitated and aggravated by several factors such as abuse of states of emergency, exercise of the powers specific to states of emergency without a formal declaration, non-observance of the principle of proportionality between the gravity of the measures taken and the E/CN.4/1994/L.44 page 4 situation concerned, too vague a definition of offences against State security, and the existence of special or emergency jurisdictions; 15.

concerned at continuing and endemic violence against women, and noting that the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women sets out various forms of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women, Mindful that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action affirmed that gender-based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation, including those resulting from cultural prejudice and international trafficking, are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated, Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children, as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims (Geneva, 30 August-1 September 1993), and

status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system-wide activity, stresses the importance of working towards the elimination of violence against women in public and private life and urges the eradication of all forms of discrimination against women, Recalling the outcome of the World Conference on Human Rights as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which affirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community, Also recalling that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action affirmed that the human rights of women should form an integral part of E/CN.4/1994/L.8/Rev.1 page 3 United Nations human rights activities, including the promotion of all human rights instruments as they relate to women, and urged Governments, institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts for the protection and promotion of the human rights of women and the girl child, Bearing in mind that the Programme of Action for the equal status and human rights of women adopted in the Vienna Declaration sets out a series of measures to be taken to further the full and equal enjoyment by women of all human rights as a priority for Governments and the United Nations, and recognizing the importance of the integration and the full participation of women as both agents and beneficiaries in the development process,

the treaty bodies, on the implementation of the resolution and in particular the action taken to create a focal point in the Centre for Human Rights for the human rights of women, Considering that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action called on the United Nations to encourage the goal of universal ratification by all States of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by the year 2000 and to avoid, as far as possible, the resort to reservations, Reaffirming that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of violence against women, Stressing that the effective implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women will contribute to the elimination of violence against women and that the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women strengthens and complements this process, Recognizing the need to promote and strengthen national and international efforts to improve the status of women in all areas in order to foster the elimination of discrimination and

the Paris AIDS Summit, of 1 December 1994, in which the participants pledged to promote and protect the rights of people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, Also welcomes the progress made in the establishment of a joint and co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS, Recalling its resolutions 1992/56 of 3 March 1992, 1993/53 of 9 March 1993 and 1994/49 of 4 March 1994 concerning discrimination against people with HIV infection or AIDS, Acknowledging the significant role of the World Health Organization, and other bodies of the United Nations system, and the major contribution made by national and international non-governmental organizations, in particular organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in fighting discrimination against and advocating the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, Noting with appreciation the Rights and Humanity Declaration and Charter on HIV and AIDS transmitted to the Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons suffering from economic, social or legal disadvantage heightens their vulnerability to the risk of HIV infection, Noting that, according to a report submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses the risk of transmission of HIV, Concerned at evidence indicating that groups in society suffering discrimination in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and disadvantage with respect to their access to education, health care and social services, are as a result more vulnerable to the risk of infection and to the personal and social impact of the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social welfare which deny people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, as well as high-risk groups, enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms, Concerned that the fear and ignorance surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there is no public health rationale for any measures that limit the rights of the individual, notably measures establishing mandatory screening, Stressing that discrimination and stigmatization are counter-productive to measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, and that anti-discrimination measures form a component part of an effective public health strategy, Emphasizing the responsibility of Governments to take measures to counter social stigmatization of and discrimination against those affected by HIV/AIDS, and their commitment to strengthen national and international mechanisms that are concerned with HIV/AIDS-related human rights and ethics, Recognizing that HIV transmission can be prevented through informed and responsible behaviour, and emphasizing the role and responsibility of individuals, groups and organs of society aimed at promoting, in a spirit of E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 4 human solidarity and tolerance, a social environment supportive of the effective prevention and eradication of the root causes of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Welcoming the report by the Secretary-General on international and domestic measures taken to protect human rights and prevent discrimination in the context of HIV/AIDS (E/CN.4/1995/45) and his recommendations therein, but noting with concern that there is insufficient information about successful strategies for protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, 1.  Confirms that discrimination on the basis of AIDS or HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that the term ""or other status"" in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts can be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS; 2. Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3. Also calls upon all States to take all the necessary steps, including appropriate and speedy redress procedures and the introduction of protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimination, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people presumed to be at risk of infection, with particular attention to women, children and vulnerable groups, and to address such concerns within their activities in the context of the International Year of Tolerance, 1995; 4, Further calls upon all States to strengthen their efforts to advance the legal, economic and social status of women, children and vulnerable groups in order to render them less vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the adverse socio-economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic; 5. Recognizes the need to protect women and girls from sexual abuse and violence and calls upon the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Working Group on E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 5 Contemporary Forms of Slavery to pay sustained attention to the risk which the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses for the transmission of HIV; 6.

Calls upon the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to keep the issue of AIDS-related discrimination under continuous review under all relevant agenda items, as well as within the work of its relevant working groups and special rapporteurs; 10. Calls upon relevant professional bodies to re-examine their codes of professional practice with a view to strengthening respect for human rights and dignity in the context of HIV/AIDS, and calls upon the relevant authorities to develop training in this regard; United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS to integrate a strong human rights component throughout the strategies and work of the future programme; 12. Requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider appropriate methods by which to keep under continuous review the protection of human rights in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to undertake with the Centre for Human Rights, in cooperation with the joint and co-sponsored United Nations programme, non-governmental agencies and other actors in the field, the task of elaborating guidelines on promoting and protecting respect E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 6 for human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, and to reflect in this regard on the possibility of organizing a second international expert consultation on human rights and AIDS; 13.

the Republic of Croatia _and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)","The Commission on Human Rights, Mindful of its duty to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, and to prevent violations of such rights, Recalling its past resolutions and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the World Conference on Human Rights, Dismayed by the continuation of the human tragedy addressed in those resolutions and decisions, and by the associated massive and systematic violations of human rights, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, E/CN.4/1995/L. 88 page 2 Repelled by the odious practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", directed principally against the Bosnian population, and emphasizing once again the right of all its victims to return to their homes in safety and dignity, the invalidity of forcible territorial gains and of forced transfers of property and other acts under duress, Deeply concerned that rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women and children continue to be used as a deliberate instrument of war and ""ethnic cleansing"", particularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dismayed by the number of missing persons still unaccounted for, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, and noting in this regard the report of the expert member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances on the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia (E/CN.4/1995/37), Deeply concerned about the situation of human rights in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo but also in Sandjak and in Vojvodina, and about the situation of the Bulgarian minority, Noting with special appreciation the continuing efforts of the Special Rapporteur and those under his direction, both in field offices and at the Centre for Human Rights, and regretting that the Special Rapporteur still has not been allowed to open an office in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Grateful for the work of the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights and of all those involved in the humanitarian relief effort, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the officers and personnel of the United Nations Protection Force, Noting with interest the meeting convened on 3 February 1995 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, after consultation with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, to develop, in close coordination with other United Nations bodies operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a coordinated and more effective response to human rights requirements in that country (E/CN.4/1995/98, para. 31) E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 3 Sustained by the international community’s continued determination to bring a peaceful, just and lasting resolution to the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, and supporting the continuing efforts of all who seek to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Welcoming especially in this regard the efforts of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, its Co-Chairmen and Steering Committee, Welcoming in particular the efforts undertaken by representatives of the international community to assist the parties in reaching a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to achieve a cease-fire, the signature of an economic agreement and the eventual resolution of the political situation in Croatia, as well as the role played by the United Nations Protection Force under very difficult circumstances, the activities of the European Commission Monitoring Mission and the European Union administration of Mostar, the constitutional provisions for the protection of human rights and other aspects of the Federation agreements of Washington and Vienna, and other proposals which could, if accepted by all parties, lead to a substantial improvement in the human rights situation of members of all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Welcoming in this regard the signature of the comprehensive cease-fire agreement on 23 December 1994, in which the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities agreed to protect the human rights of those persons residing within the territory under their control in accordance with international standards, to prompt and unconditional release of all detainees, including prisoners of war, and to release all available information on missing persons, and of the Agreement on Complete Cessation of Hostilities signed on 31 December 1994, in which the same parties also agreed to ensure full freedom of movement for the United Nations Protection Force and other international agencies in order to implement the agreement, to monitor human rights and to deliver humanitarian aid, 1.  Commends and thanks the Special Rapporteur for his continued tenacity in fulfilling his mandate under the most trying circumstances, and for the light shed by his important reports, in particular his latest reports (E/CN.4/1995/54 and Corr.1, E/CN.4/1995/57) and notes that his continuing activity can be a force to reduce human rights violations in the region; E/CN.4/1995/L. 88 page 4 2.

Reaffirms the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to find peaceful solutions through negotiations and fully to protect human rights at all times; 4. Condemns categorically all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all sides and, while recognizing that primary responsibility for most of these violations is borne by the leadership in territory under Serb control and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), notes that violations have been committed by all of the parties to the conflict; 5. Demands immediate, firm and resolute action by the international community to stop all human rights violations, to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to bring those responsible to trial; 6. Expresses alarm at the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur that nationalistic rhetoric and sweeping attacks and slurs against other national groups have been a dominant feature of reports propagated in some media in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina but especially in a systematic way by most media of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and particularly media under the control of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities, as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur, and of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities in parts of the Republic of Croatia, and that this phenomenon has led directly to the commission of fearful atrocities on the battlefields and throughout the territory, underlines in this regard the importance of ensuring the existence of independent media, and calls for immediate action by each Government to implement the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur in this regard (E/CN.4/1995/54, paras. 211-216); 7. Again denounces continued deliberate and unlawful attacks and use of military force against civilians and other protected persons by all sides, recognizing that the primary though not the sole responsibility lies with the Serbian forces; 8. Condemns the continuation, particularly in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor and Bijeljina, of the heinous and illegitimate acts identified by the E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 5 Special Rapporteur as elements of ""ethnic cleansing"", while commending the courage and sacrifice of the many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations, and urges the international community to use all its influence on the parties, in particular the authorities in parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under Serbian control and occupation, to end it immediately and to reverse its effects; 9. Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver umanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 10. Renews its expression of outrage at the use of the systematic practice of rape as a weapon of war against women and children and as an instrument of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the areas of armed conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and again recognizes that rape in these circumstances constitutes a war crime; 12. Welcomes in this connection the expanding activities of the International Tribunal established pursuant to Security Council resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, and in this context requests States, as a matter of urgency, to make available to the International Tribunal resources, services and expert personnel, including experts in the prosecution of crimes of sexual violence, as recommended by the General Assembly, and encourages voluntary contributions from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations so that the Tribunal may conduct without any further delay its stipulated functions of trying those accused of and punishing those responsible for violations of international law; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 6 13. Also welcomes the progress made by the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal, as shown by the series of indictments announced by the Tribunal, and expresses its support for this crucial effort to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law; 14. Reaffirms that States are to be held accountable for violations of uman rights, that they have the obligation to enforce respect for human rights and that they should ensure that those responsible for violations are brought to trial; 15. Requests all States, as required under Security Council resolution 827 (1993), to cooperate with the International Tribunal in providing information and evidence for investigations and trials and in the apprehension and surrender of persons accused of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; 16. Again urges the Special Rapporteur, all United Nations bodies, including the United Nations Protection Force and the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, specialized agencies, Governments and informed intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate fully with the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal and provide him on a continuing basis with all relevant and accurate information in their possession related to his task; 17. Demands the immediate internationally supervised release of all persons arbitrarily or otherwise illegally detained and the immediate closure of all places of detention not authorized by and in compliance with the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto; 18. Reiterates its demand that all parties immediately notify the International Committee of the Red Cross of the locations of all camps, prisons and other places of detention, and that there be immediate, unimpeded and continued access to such places by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Special Rapporteur and other relevant international and regional organizations; 19. Commends and thanks the expert member of the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances for his first report on the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia (E/CN.4/1995/37) ; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 7 20. Requests the Governments of Croatia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue and expand their cooperation with the special process, and strongly urges the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to begin promptly such cooperation by inviting the expert to visit the country and by disclosing all relevant available information and documentation in order finally to determine the fate of thousands of missing persons and to alleviate the suffering of their relatives; 22. Requests the Secretary-General to continue providing the special process with the necessary resources, from within available resources of the regular budget of the United Nations, so that it is enabled to perform its functions continuously and expeditiously; 23. Expresses its grave concern at the continued deterioration of the human rights situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), particularly in Kosovo, as described by the Special Rapporteur, and again condemns the violations of human rights occurring there, including police brutality, arbitrary killings, searches, seizures and arrests, torture and ill-treatment, the closure of Albanian secondary schools and the Albanian University, the elimination of the Albanian language in public administration and services, mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians, discriminatory laws and the attempt to change the ethnic structure of Kosovo, as well as prevention of the return of Albanians from abroad; 24. Again demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, recalling that the best means to prevent the possible escalation of the conflict is to safeguard human rights, restore genuine autonomy and establish democratic institutions in Kosovo; 25. Expresses its grave concern at renewed reports of violations of human rights in Sandjak and in Vojvodina and concerning members of the Bulgarian minority, as noted by the Special Rapporteur, while commending the courage and sacrifice of many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 8 26. Urges all parties in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, to engage in a substantive dialogue, under the auspices of, among others, the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, to act with the utmost restraint and to settle disputes peacefully and with full respect for human rights; 27. Demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) permit entry into Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina of United Nations observer missions and field officers of the Special Rapporteur and resumption of the missions of long duration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; 28.

Welcomes the efforts by the Governments of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to uphold human rights in their territories, urges them to fulfil the human rights commitments they have made, and in particular asks the Republic of Croatia to eliminate the arbitrary practices on the part of the Croatian authorities, as reported by the Special Rapporteur; 30. Condemns the continuation of ""ethnic cleansing"" in areas under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities in the United Nations Protected Areas; recommendations have not been fully implemented, in some cases because of resistance by the parties on the ground, and again strongly urges the parties, all States and relevant organizations to give immediate consideration to them; 32.

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1.  Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1.  Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that person’s approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2.

Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor.

CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1.  In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages.

The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1.

As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1.  Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1.  Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. PART TWO. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS CHAPTER I.

question, Considering that the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the basic purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and one of the main priorities of the Organization, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 2 Recalling that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of strengthening the Centre for Human Rights, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/116), as well as of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/103), Recalling the note by the Secretary-General on the geographical composition and functions of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights (A/50/682), Taking into account that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to take immediate steps to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations, and to take urgent steps to seek increased extrabudgetary resources, Taking into account also the establishment of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the mandate for the post, as defined in General Assembly resolution 48/141, including its coordinating role and its overall supervision of the Centre, as well as the request by the General Assembly in that resolution for appropriate staff and resources to enable the High Commissioner to fulfil his mandate, Noting with concern that the response to this request has not been commensurate with the needs, resulting in a serious and increasing imbalance between the mandates assigned to the High Commissioner and to the Centre by the competent bodies of the United Nations system in the field of human rights and the resources available to fulfil those mandates, Taking into account the fact that the responsibilities of the High Commissioner include, inter alia, engaging in a dialogue with all Governments in the implementation of his mandate with a view to the promotion and protection of all human rights, and rationalizing, adapting, strengthening and streamlining the United Nations machinery in the field of human rights with a view to improving its efficiency and effectiveness, Mindful of situations in which rapid action by the High Commissioner for Human Rights is required in order to address urgent crises in the field of human rights, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 3 Aware that the effectiveness of action by the High Commissioner for Human Rights could be enhanced through cooperation within the United Nations system, inter alia, through the use of its established procedures of existing mechanisms, Noting that the difficult financial situation of the United Nations human rights programme has created considerable obstacles in implementing in full and on time the various procedures and mechanisms, Noting also that the High Commissioner and the Centre are a unity whereby the High Commissioner, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141, sets the policy directions and the priority of action and the Centre implements those policies under the direction of the head of the Centre, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Emphasizing that, while further improvement in the function and efficiency of the Centre, together with a strong emphasis on good management practices, is needed in order to enable the Centre to cope with its constantly increasing workload, good management practices need to be complemented by resources commensurate with mandates, Taking note of the information provided by the High Commissioner with regard to the ongoing process aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre, and encouraging the High Commissioner to continue to inform Member States on his efforts in a similar manner, inter alia through briefing sessions, Recognizing that this process should contribute to the strengthening of the functional framework for integrated and consolidated activities of the Secretariat in the field of human rights, while reaffirming full respect for the mandates given to the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Centre by the appropriate intergovernmental bodies, Recalling that in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that the paramount consideration in the employment of staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and that it was convinced that that was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution, and bearing in mind Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 4 1.

1997,SIXTH COMMITTEE,Fifty-second session,148,REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ON THE WORK OF ITS THIRTIETH SESSION,"Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norwa Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United States of America and Venezuela",N/A,Model Law _on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,"The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade, Noting that increased cross-border trade and investment leads to greater incidence of cases where enterprises and individuals have assets in more than one State, Noting also that when a debtor with assets in more than one State becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding, there often exists an urgent need for cross-border cooperation and coordination in the supervision and administration of the insolvent debtor's assets and affairs, Considering that inadequate coordination and cooperation in cases of cross- border insolvency reduce the possibility of rescuing financially troubled but viable businesses, impede a fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, make it more likely that the debtor's assets would be concealed or dissipated and hinder reorganizations or liquidations of debtors' assets and affairs that would be the most advantageous for the creditors and other interested persons, including the debtors and the debtors' employees, Noting that many States lack a legislative framework that would make possible or facilitate effective cross-border coordination and cooperation, Convinced that fair and internationally harmonized legislation on cross- border insolvency that respects the national procedural and judicial systems and is acceptable to States with different legal, social and economic systems would contribute to the development of international trade and investment, Considering that a set of internationally harmonized model legislative provisions on cross-border insolvency is needed to assist States in modernizing their legislation governing cross-border insolvency, 1.  Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for completing and adopting the Model law on Cross- Border Insolvency contained in the annex to the present resolution; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Model Law, together with the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law prepared by the Secretariat, to Governments and other interested bodies; 3. Recommends that all States review their legislation on cross-border aspects of insolvency to determine whether the legislation meets the objectives of a modern and efficient insolvency system and, in that review, give favourable consideration to the Model Law, bearing in mind the need for an internationally harmonized legislation governing instances of cross-border insolvency; 4. Recommends also that all efforts be made to ensure that the Model Law, together with the Guide, become generally known and available. ANNEX Model _Law_on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law PREAMBLE The purpose of this Law is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of: (a) Cooperation between the courts and other competent authorities of this State and foreign States involved in cases of cross-border insolvency; (b) Greater legal certainty for trade and investment; (c) Fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested persons, including the debtor; (d) Protection and maximization of the value of the debtor's assets; and (e) Facilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.
