High Commissioner on 9 November 1994, 3/ Recalling its resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993, Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial importance of the High Commissioner’s functions of providing international protection to refugees and seeking solutions to refugee problems, Welcoming the continuing strong commitment of States to

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection

other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that,

December 1991, 48/129 of 20 December 1993 and 49/195 of 23 December 1994, and bearing in mind all relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Human Rights, Considering that the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the basic purposes of the United Nations enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and a priority activity of the Organization, Taking into account that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, concerned by the growing disparity between the activities of the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat and the human, financial and other resources available to carry them out, and bearing in mind the resources needed for other important United Nations programmes, requested the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to take immediate steps to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme, 1/ Noting that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of strengthening the Centre, 2/ Taking into account the establishment of the post of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the mandate for the post, including its coordinating role and its overall

rights, and rationalizing, adapting, strengthening and streamlining the United Nations machinery in the field of human rights with a view to improving its efficiency and effectiveness, Noting the persistence of a serious imbalance between mandates to be carried out under the human rights programme and resources available to fulfil those mandates, Concerned at the difficult financial situation and the understaffing of the Office of the High Commissioner and of the Centre, which creates considerable obstacles to carrying out their mandates in full and on time, including those pertaining to the right to development, Acknowledging that, while further improvement in the function and efficiency of the Centre, together with a strong emphasis on good management practices, is needed in order to enable the Centre to cope with its constantly increasing workload, good management practices need to be complemented by additional resources commensurate with additional mandates, Welcoming the ongoing process aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre as well as the steps already taken to strengthen its administrative services, Recognizing that this process will contribute to the strengthening of the functional framework for integrated and consolidated activities of the Secretariat in the field of human rights, Recalling that in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council, 3/ the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that the paramount consideration in the employment of staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and that it was convinced that that was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution, and bearing in mind Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat, 4/ as well as the report

1993 and 49/215 of 23 December 1994 on assistance in mine clearance, both adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines

other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the international community, Recognizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, in

peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof

of mine clearance needs to improve substantially if the global land-mine problem is to be effectively tackled, Recalling its resolution 50/74 of 12 December 1995 on the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects 2/ and the convening by the Secretary-General of the Review Conference of the States Parties to that Convention at Vienna from 25 September to 13 October 1995, taking note, in this regard, of the decision of the Review Conference to continue its work in order

moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, and welcoming, in this regard, the export moratorium adopted by several States, Bearing in mind that significant progress needs to be achieved in these fields, Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has an important role in the field of assistance in mine clearance, Noting with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandates of several peace- keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and see solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the Secretary-General through the work of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat in increasing public awareness of the problem of land-mines and for the establishment of the Central Land-mine Database and its inventories of mine-awareness materials and mine- clearance techniques, Commending in particular the outcome of the International Meeting on Mine Clearance held at Geneva

United Nations, 1.  Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the activities of the United Nations on assistance in mine-clearance and the operation of the voluntary trust fund, and takes note with interest of the proposals contained therein; 3/ 2. Welcomes, in particular, the efforts made by the United Nations to foster the establishment of national mine-clearance capacities in countries where mines constitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives of the local population, and urges all Member States, particularly those that have a capacity to do so, to assist afflicted countries in the establishment and development of their national mine-clearance capacities; 3. Expresses its appreciation to Member States, United Nations organizations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that participated in the International Meeting on Mine Clearance for their strong expression of cooperation in the field of assistance in mine clearance, and particularly States and regional organizations for their financial contributions to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance as well as for providing the necessary means to establish a de-mining stand-by capacity within the United Nations; 4, Appeals to Member States as well as to intergovernmental organizations and foundations to continue to contribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance and to continue to supply the necessary means to the United Nations to foster its de-mining stand-by capacity; 5.
