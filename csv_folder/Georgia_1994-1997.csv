crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection

In this World Year of Peopleâs Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression. 3. We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Only in this way can we prevent new tragedies and ensure that all nations become a community living in peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity.",10/11/1995,1995_199817,Georgia,1/ Resolution 217 A (III).,yes

in the mandates of several peace- keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and see solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the Secretary-General through the work of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat in increasing public awareness of the problem of land-mines and for the establishment of the Central
