The First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Manila, the Philippines, in June 1988. Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E. Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3. The Conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the exchange of experiences initiated in Manila; it also recognized the value of democracy as an integral part of political processes for the reconciliation and development of national societies and for peace and security in the international community within a broader and comprehensive concept of security. 4. In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7.
