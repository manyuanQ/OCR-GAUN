crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection

numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that,

The First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Manila, the Philippines, in June 1988. Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E. Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3. The Conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the exchange of experiences initiated in Manila; it also recognized the value of democracy as an integral part of political processes for the reconciliation and development of national societies and for peace and security in the international community within a broader and comprehensive concept of security. 4. In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly , to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7.

trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances, including synthetic or designer drugs, that threaten the health and well-being of millions of persons, in particular the youth, in all countries of the world, Gravely concerned that, despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations, the illicit demand for, production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic

and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production, traffic and distribution of drugs, arms and precursor and essential chemicals, which at times places them beyond the reach of the law, corrupting institutions, undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world, Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money laundering, and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals, Fully aware that States, the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge, which undermines development, economic and political stability and

the export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting that according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Assistance in mine clearance"", 1/ it is estimated that there are more than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the

twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and

prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1.

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1. Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1. Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that personâs approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the absence of a signature. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 8 Original 1. Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in its original form, that requirement is met by a data message if: (a) There exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as a data message or otherwise; and (b) Where it is required that information be presented, that information is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to be presented. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being presented or retained in its original form. 3.

In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of a data message in evidence: (a) On the sole ground that it is a data message; or (b) If it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form. 2. Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor.

A person may satisfy the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 by using the services of any other person, provided that the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 are met. CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1. In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages. Where a data message is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that purpose. 2. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1. As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, a declaration of will or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. A/C.6/51/L.8 that of the originator if it was sent: (a) By a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or (b) By an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically. 3. As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1. Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addresseeâs acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. PART TWO. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS CHAPTER I.
