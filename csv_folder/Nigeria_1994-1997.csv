Development proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 2542 (XXIV) of 11 December 1969 and the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, Bearing in mind resolutions 1989/20 and 1989/21 of 31 August 1989, 1990/16 of 30 August 1990, 1991/27 of 29 August 1991, 1992/29 of 27 August 1992, 1993/40 of 26 August 1993

Having in mind the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and the Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s, adopted by the World Summit for Children on 30 September 1990, Aware that the serious problem of foreign debt remains one of the most acute factors adversely affecting

the capacity to pay have not moved in consonance with the E/CN.4/1995/L.18/Rev.1 page 3 debt-service obligations of the majority of developing countries and that the prospects for reducing the adverse effects of the debt burden on the development process in developing countries continue to be uncertain, Noting that developing countries still meet their debt obligations at considerable cost to their economies, Noting with regret the negative effects of the policies adopted to face situations of external debt on the realization and enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, Stressing that the present international economic order continues to be unfair and needs to be transformed, Stressing also that measures for debt reduction need to be accompanied by vigorous measures aimed at improving the international economic environment in order to facilitate the growth and development of developing countries, Considering that the new strategies for solving the debt problem, of both official and private origin, require policies of economic adjustment accompanied by growth and development and that it is essential, within those policies, to give priority consideration in their implementation to human conditions, including standards of living, health, food, education and employment of the population, especially among the most vulnerable and low-income groups, Taking into

Emphasizes that, in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction, there is a need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries, and urges the creditor countries and the multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance in order to support the implementation by the developing countries of their economic reform programmes, so as to enable them to achieve adequate technological and productive progress and extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving economic growth and development and to compensate in some measure the developing countries which meet their obligations at considerable cost to their economies; 5. Affirms that debt payments should not take precedence over the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, shelter, clothing, employment, health services and a healthy environment; 6.

Considers that in order to find a durable solution to the debt crisis of developing countries and in addition to technical measures that should be implemented in order to alleviate the debt burden of those countries, there is a need for a political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries in the United Nations system, based on the principle of E/CN.4/1995/L.18/Rev.1 page 5 shared responsibility, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to recommend ways and means to carry out this dialogue, and to submit a report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session; 12.

trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances, including synthetic or designer drugs, that threaten the health and well-being of millions of persons, in particular the youth, in all countries of the world, Gravely concerned that, despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations, the illicit demand for, production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including synthetic or designer drugs, has expanded globally and, therefore, continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production, traffic and distribution of drugs, arms and precursor and essential chemicals, which at times places them beyond the reach of the law, corrupting institutions, undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world, Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money laundering, and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals, Fully aware that States, the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge, which undermines development, economic and political stability and democratic institutions, and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives, Convinced of the desirability of closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating drug-related crimes, such as terrorism, illicit arms trade and money laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect, Reaffirming that a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in drug control is provided by the existing drug control conventions, the Declaration 1/ and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control, 2/ the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly

maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, 7/ Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Emphasizing the need for an analysis of transit routes used by drug traffickers, which are constantly changing and expanding to include a growing number of countries and regions in all parts of the world, Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues, Reaffirming the leadership role of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted international action for drug abuse control and commending the way in which it has carried out the functions entrusted to it, Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces, and require the formulation of new strategies, approaches and objectives that, respectful of the sovereignty of States, can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms, the diversion of
