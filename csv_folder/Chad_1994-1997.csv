2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the

twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned

prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to

emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1.
