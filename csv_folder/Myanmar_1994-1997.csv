trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances, including synthetic or designer drugs, that threaten the health and well-being of millions of persons, in particular the youth, in all countries of the world, Gravely concerned that, despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations, the illicit demand for, production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including synthetic or designer drugs, has expanded globally and, therefore, continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production, traffic and distribution of drugs, arms and precursor and essential chemicals, which at times places them beyond the reach of the law, corrupting institutions, undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world, Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money laundering, and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals, Fully aware that States, the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge, which undermines development, economic and political stability and democratic institutions, and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives, Convinced of the desirability of closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating drug-related crimes, such as terrorism, illicit arms trade and money laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect, Reaffirming that a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in drug control is provided by the existing drug control conventions, the
