and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production, traffic and distribution of drugs, arms and precursor and essential chemicals, which at times places them beyond the reach of the law, corrupting institutions, undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world, Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money laundering, and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals, Fully aware that States, the relevant organizations
