The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization (resolution EB93.R5) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (resolution 144EX-5. 1. 5), and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: E/1994/L.18/Rev.1 I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS.

This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13.

The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms.

VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution.

African Group), India, Indonesia, Nicaragua and Sri Lanka: revised",1997.0,"Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance","The Commission on Human Rights , Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenants on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Reaffirming also its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism in all its forms and racial discrimination, and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a total negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Reaffirming further its resolution 1996/21 of 19 April 1996 and recalling General Assembly resolution 51/79 of 12 December 1996, as well as resolution 1996/8 of 20 August 1996 of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, E/CN.4/1997/L.12/Rev.1 page 2 Mindful of General Assembly resolution 45/105 of 14 December 1990, in which the Assembly declared once again that all forms of racism and racial discrimination, particularly in their institutionalized form, such as apartheid, or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity, were among the most serious violations of human rights in the contemporary world and must be combated by all available means, Recalling the recommendations of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in 1978 and 1983, Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which calls for the speedy and comprehensive elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, any form of discrimination, inter alia, against Blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia, negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as an institutionalized governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance taking place in segments of many societies and perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which are directed against migrant workers and their families, Noting with grave concern that, despite the efforts of the international community, the principal objectives of two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, Noting General Assembly resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, in which the General Assembly decided to proclaim the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, beginning in 1993, and to adopt the Programme of Action proposed for the Third Decade, E/CN.4/1997/L.12/Rev.1 page 3 Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (E/CN.4/1997/71) and its two addenda as well as addenda 2, 3 and 4 to the Special Rapporteur's previous report (E/CN.4/1996/72), Observing that the manifestations of contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance bode ill for the international community, that racist propaganda and incitement to racial hatred are spreading and that racism is taking increasingly violent forms, Noting the conclusion contained in the final report of the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of opinion and expression of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1992/9) that, under international law, racism is not an opinion but an offence, Reaffirming its resolution 1996/46 of 19 April 1996, entitled âHuman rights and thematic proceduresâ, in which, inter alia, it invited the Governments concerned to study carefully the recommendations addressed to them under thematic procedures and to keep the relevant mechanisms informed promptly on the progress made towards their implementation, Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Emphasizing the importance of the activities of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling General Assembly resolution 51/81 of 12 December 1996, in which the Assembly called upon the Commission on Human Rights to consider at its fifty-third session, as a matter of priority, the question of a possible world conference to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related contemporary forms of intolerance, and to make appropriate recommendations,
