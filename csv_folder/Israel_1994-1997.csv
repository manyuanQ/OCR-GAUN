activities of her Office 1/ and the report of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner on the work of its forty-fifth session, 2/ and taking note of the statement made by the High Commissioner on 9 November 1994, 3/ Recalling its resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993, Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial importance of the High Commissioner’s functions of providing international protection to refugees and seeking solutions to refugee problems, Welcoming the continuing strong commitment of States to provide protection and assistance to refugees and the valuable support extended by Governments to the High Commissioner in carrying out her humanitarian tasks, Also welcoming the strong commitment made by States, in the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development, 6/ held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994, to the institution of asylum and to refugees and displaced persons, Emphasizing the need for States to assist the High Commissioner in seeking durable and timely solutions to the problems of refugees, and to take part in efforts to prevent conditions that might give rise to the flight of refugees, and to address the root causes of refugee outflows, and underlining, in this connection, State responsibility, particularly as it relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries around the world, Commending also those States, particularly the least developed and those hosting millions of refugees over long periods of time, which, despite severe economic, development and environmental challenges of their own, continue to admit large numbers of refugees into their territories, and emphasizing the need to share the burden of those States to the maximum extent possible through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection has continued to increase and that their protection continues to be seriously jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission, unlawful expulsion, refoulement, unjustified detention, other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that, in a number of instances, the internally displaced are present alongside refugees, returnees or a vulnerable local population, in situations where it is neither reasonable nor feasible to treat the categories differently in responding to their needs for assistance and protection, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the High Commissioner to meet the protection and assistance needs of refugee women and children, who constitute the majority of the world’s refugee population and who are often exposed to serious threats to their safety and well-being, Noting with concern the persistent problems of stateless persons in various regions and the emergence of new situations of statelessness, 1.

Calls upon all States to assist and support the High Commissioner’s efforts to continue to provide international protection and assistance, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions, to persons who have been forced to flee or to remain outside their countries of origin as a result of danger to their life or freedom owing to situations of conflict, and to seek solutions to the problems arising from their forced displacement; 7. Recognizes the desirability of exploring further measures to ensure international protection to all who need it, including temporary protection and other forms of asylum oriented towards repatriation, in situations of conflict or persecution involving large-scale outflows and in which return home is considered the most appropriate durable solution, and encourages the High Commissioner to continue to promote international cooperation and to engage in further consultations and discussions concerning measures to achieve this objective, acknowledging the value of regional arrangements in this regard; 8. Stresses the importance of international solidarity and burden-sharing in reinforcing the international protection of refugees, and urges all States, and relevant non-governmental organizations, in conjunction with the Office of the High Commissioner, to cooperate in efforts to lighten the burden borne by States that have received large numbers of asylum-seekers and refugees; 9. Reiterates that voluntary repatriation, when it is feasible, is the ideal solution to refugee problems, calls upon countries of origin, countries of asylum, the Office of the High Commissioner and the international community as a whole to do everything possible to enable refugees to exercise freely their right to return home in safety and dignity, ensuring that international protection continues to be extended until that time, and assisting, where needed, the return and reintegration of repatriating refugees, and further calls upon the High Commissioner, in cooperation with States concerned, to promote, facilitate and coordinate the voluntary repatriation of refugees, including the monitoring of their safety and well-being on return; 10. Calls for a more concerted response by the international community to the needs of internally displaced persons and, in accordance with its resolution 48/116, reaffirms its support for the High Commissioner’s efforts, on the basis of specific requests from the Secretary-General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations and with the consent of the State concerned, and taking into account the complementarities of the mandates and expertise of other relevant organizations, to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to such persons, emphasizing that activities on behalf of internally displaced persons must not undermine the institution of asylum, including the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution; 12.

Emphasizes the need, particularly in complex emergencies that include humanitarian and peace-keeping operations, to ensure respect for the High Commissioner’s protection mandate and to preserve the impartial and purely humanitarian nature of the activities of the Office; 17. Expresses profound concern at conditions in a number of countries and regions that seriously endanger the security of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and other relief workers, deplores the loss of lives among such personnel, urges support for initiatives taken by the High Commissioner and within the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning the safety of United Nations and associated personnel, in particular the consideration of new measures to enhance the safety of such personnel, and calls upon States and all parties to conflicts to take all necessary measures to ensure the security of international and local staff undertaking humanitarian work in the countries concerned; 18.

Encourages the High Commissioner to continue to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training, legal awareness and education and, in particular, in the area of reproductive health, with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees, in conformity with universally recognized international human rights; 20.

The First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Manila, the Philippines, in June 1988. Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E. Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3. The Conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the exchange of experiences initiated in Manila; it also recognized the value of democracy as an integral part of political processes for the reconciliation and development of national societies and for peace and security in the international community within a broader and comprehensive concept of security. 4. In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7. Consequently, we request the inclusion in the agenda of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly of an additional item entitled ""Support by the United Nations system for the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies"".

E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 2 Mindful that respect for the principle of non-discrimination is the key to the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized in international instruments, Recalling General Assembly resolutions 45/187 of 21 December 1990 and 46/203 of 20 December 1991, Economic and Social Council resolution 1990/86 of 27 July 1990, World

the Paris AIDS Summit, of 1 December 1994, in which the participants pledged to promote and protect the rights of people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, Also welcomes the progress made in the establishment of a joint and co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS, Recalling its resolutions 1992/56 of 3 March 1992, 1993/53 of 9 March 1993 and 1994/49 of 4 March 1994 concerning discrimination against people with HIV infection or AIDS, Acknowledging the significant role of the World Health Organization, and other bodies of the United Nations system, and the major contribution made by national and international non-governmental organizations, in particular organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in fighting discrimination against and advocating the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, Noting with appreciation the Rights and Humanity Declaration and Charter on HIV and AIDS transmitted to the Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons suffering from economic, social or legal disadvantage heightens their vulnerability to the risk of HIV infection, Noting that, according to a report submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses the risk of transmission of HIV, Concerned at evidence indicating that groups in society suffering discrimination in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and disadvantage with respect to their access to education, health care and social services, are as a result more vulnerable to the risk of infection and to the personal and social impact of the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social welfare which deny people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, as well as high-risk groups, enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms, Concerned that the fear and ignorance surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there is no public health rationale for any measures that limit the rights of the individual, notably measures establishing mandatory screening, Stressing that discrimination and stigmatization are counter-productive to measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, and that anti-discrimination measures form a component part of an effective public health strategy, Emphasizing the responsibility of Governments to take measures to counter social stigmatization of and discrimination against those affected by HIV/AIDS, and their commitment to strengthen national and international mechanisms that are concerned with HIV/AIDS-related human rights and ethics, Recognizing that HIV transmission can be prevented through informed and responsible behaviour, and emphasizing the role and responsibility of individuals, groups and organs of society aimed at promoting, in a spirit of E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 4 human solidarity and tolerance, a social environment supportive of the effective prevention and eradication of the root causes of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Welcoming the report by the Secretary-General on international and domestic measures taken to protect human rights and prevent discrimination in the context of HIV/AIDS (E/CN.4/1995/45) and his recommendations therein, but noting with concern that there is insufficient information about successful strategies for protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, 1.  Confirms that discrimination on the basis of AIDS or HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that the term ""or other status"" in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts can be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS; 2. Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3. Also calls upon all States to take all the necessary steps, including appropriate and speedy redress procedures and the introduction of protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimination, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people presumed to be at risk of infection, with particular attention to women, children and vulnerable groups, and to address such concerns within their activities in the context of the International Year of Tolerance, 1995; 4, Further calls upon all States to strengthen their efforts to advance the legal, economic and social status of women, children and vulnerable groups in order to render them less vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the adverse socio-economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic; 5. Recognizes the need to protect women and girls from sexual abuse and violence and calls upon the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Working Group on E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 5 Contemporary Forms of Slavery to pay sustained attention to the risk which the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses for the transmission of HIV; 6.

In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules of evidence shall apply so as to deny the admissibility of a data message in evidence: (a) On the sole ground that it is a data message; or (b) If it is the best evidence that the person adducing it could reasonably be expected to obtain, on the grounds that it is not in its original form. 2. Information in the form of a data message shall be given due evidential weight. In assessing the evidential weight of a data message, regard shall be had to the reliability of the manner in which the data message was generated, stored or communicated, to the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, to the manner in which its originator was identified, and to any other relevant factor.

CHAPTER III. COMMUNICATION OF DATA MESSAGES Article 11 Formation and validity of contracts 1.  In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages. Where a data message is used in the formation of a contract, that contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that a data message was used for that purpose. 2. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 12 Recognition by parties of data messages 1.  As between the originator and the addressee of a data message, a declaration of will or other statement shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. A/C.6/51/L.8 that of the originator if it was sent: (a) By a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or (b) By an information system programmed by or on behalf of the originator to operate automatically. 3. As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1.  Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1.  Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5.

Urges all States Parties to arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements to implement and comply with the entirety of all provisions of such agreements; 2. Calls upon all Member States to give serious consideration to the implications that non-compliance by States Parties with any provisions of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements has for international security and stability, as well as for the prospects for progress in the field of disarmament; 3.

1997,SIXTH COMMITTEE,Fifty-second session,148,REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ON THE WORK OF ITS THIRTIETH SESSION,"Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norwa Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United States of America and Venezuela",N/A,Model Law _on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,"The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade, Noting that increased cross-border trade and investment leads to greater incidence of cases where enterprises and individuals have assets in more than one State, Noting also that when a debtor with assets in more than one State becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding, there often exists an urgent need for cross-border cooperation and coordination in the supervision and administration of the insolvent debtor's assets and affairs, Considering that inadequate coordination and cooperation in cases of cross- border insolvency reduce the possibility of rescuing financially troubled but viable businesses, impede a fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, make it more likely that the debtor's assets would be concealed or dissipated and hinder reorganizations or liquidations of debtors' assets and affairs that would be the most advantageous for the creditors and other interested persons, including the debtors and the debtors' employees, Noting that many States lack a legislative framework that would make possible or facilitate effective cross-border coordination and cooperation, Convinced that fair and internationally harmonized legislation on cross- border insolvency that respects the national procedural and judicial systems and is acceptable to States with different legal, social and economic systems would contribute to the development of international trade and investment, Considering that a set of internationally harmonized model legislative provisions on cross-border insolvency is needed to assist States in modernizing their legislation governing cross-border insolvency, 1.  Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for completing and adopting the Model law on Cross- Border Insolvency contained in the annex to the present resolution; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Model Law, together with the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law prepared by the Secretariat, to Governments and other interested bodies; 3. Recommends that all States review their legislation on cross-border aspects of insolvency to determine whether the legislation meets the objectives of a modern and efficient insolvency system and, in that review, give favourable consideration to the Model Law, bearing in mind the need for an internationally harmonized legislation governing instances of cross-border insolvency; 4. Recommends also that all efforts be made to ensure that the Model Law, together with the Guide, become generally known and available. ANNEX Model _Law_on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law PREAMBLE The purpose of this Law is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of: (a) Cooperation between the courts and other competent authorities of this State and foreign States involved in cases of cross-border insolvency; (b) Greater legal certainty for trade and investment; (c) Fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested persons, including the debtor; (d) Protection and maximization of the value of the debtor's assets; and (e) Facilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.
