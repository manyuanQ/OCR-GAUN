repercussions of structural adjustment programmes on the realization and full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, Recognizing the need to address the obstacles that impede the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights all over the world, Aware of the fact that the Working Group on the Right to Development identified the problem of foreign debt as one of the obstacles to development and, consequently, to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, Deeply concerned that the debt-service obligations remain high, that the factors determining the capacity to pay have not moved in consonance with the debt-service obligations of the majority of developing countries and that the prospects for reducing the adverse effects of the debt burden on the development process in developing countries continue to be uncertain, Noting that developing countries still meet their debt obligations at considerable cost to their economies, Noting with regret the negative effects of the policies adopted to face situations of external debt burden on the realization and enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, Stressing that the present international economic order continues to be unfair and needs to be transformed, E/CN.4/1996/L.20 page 3 Stressing also that measures for debt reduction need to be accompanied by vigorous measures aimed at improving the international economic environment in order to facilitate the growth and development of developing countries,

essential, within those policies, to give priority consideration in their implementation to human conditions, including standards of living, housing, health, food, education and employment of the population, especially among the most vulnerable and low-income groups, Taking into account the particular concern expressed by the General Assembly at the growing deterioration of living conditions

Urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance in order to support the E/CN.4/1996/L.20 page 4 implementation by the developing countries of their economic reform programmes that enable them to achieve adequate technological and productive progress, to extricate themselves from debt overhang, to obtain economic growth and development and to compensate, in some measure, the developing countries that meet their obligations at considerable cost to their economies; 6. Affirms that debt repayments should not take precedence over the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, shelter, clothing, employment, health services and a healthy environment; 7. Stresses that foreign debt continues to be one of the major obstacles to the realization of the right to development; 8.
