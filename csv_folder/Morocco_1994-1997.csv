crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries

through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection

other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within

The programme comprises the following United Nations system organizations: the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank. The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization (resolution EB93.R5) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (resolution 144EX-5. 1. 5), and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: E/1994/L.18/Rev.1 I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13.

These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/20/1994,1994_191736,Morocco,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.

On this principle there is general agreement. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , this principle should be reflected in the Organizationâs functioning in the equal treatment accorded to the official and working languages of the United Nations. It sometimes happens, however, that this essential principle of equality is not respected in the different bodies. Various justifications are cited: financial reasons, the unavailability of interpretation or translation services, the urgent nature of the work at hand, and so on. In the heat of the moment, some delegations may be tempted not to react when asked to waive their right to work in the official language of the Organization chosen by them and to be provided with documentation in that language. In the long term, however, this waiver has a particularly nefarious effect in that it is the embryonic form of a tendency to accept a virtually monolingual United Nations. Far from being simpler, cheaper or better, failure on the Organizationâs part to respect the multilingualism which is its rule and which it should strictly enforce would necessarily lead to the decline and impoverishment of discussions, to the development of stereotypes, to bureaucracy and to a waning of the interest of peoples in the United Nations. It would be wrong, however, to fall into the trap of believing that such a trend is inevitable. All that is required is vigilance to insist at all times that Member States should receive from the Organization the service to which they are entitled under the constitutional texts. This means, in particular, that the Secretariat should make it a rule to employ in its relations with Member States the official language which the latter choose to use. This requirement naturally has implications in terms of the linguistic skills which should rightfully be expected from staff of the United Nations. It may be useful to recall this unequivocally. It is noticeable that the staffing of the interpretation and translation services has not expanded at the same rate as the increase in the activities of the various United Nations bodies over the past few years. As a result, there are delays in making documents available in the official languages and meetings are postponed because of the lack of teams of interpreters. All this hampers the proper functioning of the Organization and gives the impression that the delegations which insist on having the services required for the meaningful practice of multilingualism are troublemakers who are overly intransigent. This is a very serious perversion of the system and the only way to avoid it is for the interpretation and translation services to have staff and resources which, Joes despite budgetary constraints, remain adequate to deal with the increasing workload. The practice of holding ""informal"" meetings without interpretation or circulating ""unofficial"" documents in one language only can in no way be an acceptable solution to these shortcomings. Cultural and linguistic diversity is a responsible choice which the United Nations is perfectly able to make if it exhibits in this regard the far- sightedness and determination that are necessary in order to avoid taking the easy way out. The resolution submitted by the signatories is intended precisely to recall this constant objective, this requirement which is particularly relevant at the dawn of the second fifty years of the Organizationâs existence. APPENDIX Draft resolution Multilingualism The General Assembly , Recalling its resolutions 2 (I) of 1 February 1946, 2241 B (XXI) of 20 December 1966, 2292 (XXII) of 8 December 1967, 2359 B (XXII) of 19 December 1967, 2479 (XXIII) and 2480 B (XXIII) of 21 December 1968, 3189 (XXVIII), 3190 (XXVIII) and 3191 (XXVIII) of 18 December 1973 and 43/224 D of 21 December 1988, Recalling also, on the occasion of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, that the universality of the United Nations and its corollary of multilingualism require each State Member of the Organization, whatever the official or working language in which it expresses itself, to make itself understood just as it should endeavour to understand others, Stressing the need for strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the different bodies and organs of the United Nations, Regretting that unequal use is made of the different working languages and official languages within the United Nations, and desiring that persons recruited by the Organization should have a command of and make use of at least one working language and one official language, Considering that the translation and interpretation budgets of United Nations bodies should be commensurate with requirements and exempt from any restrictive budgetary measures, as recalled in resolution 42/207 C of 11 December 1987, Noting that the principle of equality of the official languages and of the working languages is being called into question with increasing frequency by the holding of so-called ""reduced cost"" informal meetings, 1.

Strongly condemns the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur in his reports, most of which are committed in connection with the systematic policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocidal acts in the areas of the former Yugoslavia under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities, and which include mass killing, torture, disappearances, rape, and other sexual abuses against women and children, use of civilians as human shields on confrontation lines and as mine clearers, arbitrary executions, destruction of houses, religious objects and cultural and historical heritage, forced and illegal evictions, detentions, arbitrary searches and other acts of violence; 4.

Stresses in this context the importance of the closure of the international border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the sealing of border crossing points in accordance with the expressed desire of the international community in support of the acceptance of the Contact Groupâs territorial proposal; 16.
