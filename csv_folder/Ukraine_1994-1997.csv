1993 and 49/215 of 23 December 1994 on assistance in mine clearance, both adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines

other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the

peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof

the main priorities of the Organization, E/CN.4/1996/L.65 page 2 Recalling that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights stressed the importance of strengthening the Centre for Human Rights, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/116), as well as of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/103), Recalling the note by the Secretary-General on the geographical composition and functions of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights (A/50/682), Taking into account that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights

unity whereby the High Commissioner, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141, sets the policy directions and the priority of action and the Centre implements those policies under the direction of the head of the Centre, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Emphasizing that, while further improvement in the function and efficiency of the Centre, together with a strong emphasis on good management practices, is needed in order to enable the Centre to cope with its constantly increasing workload, good management practices need to be complemented by resources commensurate with mandates, Taking note of the information provided by the High Commissioner with regard to the ongoing process aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre, and

Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Centre by the appropriate intergovernmental bodies, Recalling that in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission

measures, is called for, Encouraged by the widespread commitment and political will shown by the unprecedented number of States that have to date become signatories and parties to the Convention on
