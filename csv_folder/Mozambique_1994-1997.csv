activities of her Office 1/ and the report of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner on the work of its forty-fifth session, 2/ and taking note of the statement made by the High Commissioner on 9 November 1994, 3/ Recalling its resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993, Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial importance of the High Commissionerâs functions of providing international protection to refugees and seeking solutions to refugee problems, Welcoming the continuing strong commitment of States to provide protection and assistance to refugees and the valuable support extended by Governments to the High Commissioner in carrying out her humanitarian tasks, Also welcoming the strong commitment made by States, in the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development, 6/ held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994, to the institution of asylum and to refugees and displaced persons, Emphasizing the need for States to assist the High Commissioner in seeking durable and timely solutions to the problems of refugees, and to take part in efforts to prevent conditions that might give rise to the flight of refugees, and to address the root causes of refugee outflows, and underlining, in this connection, State responsibility, particularly as it relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries around the world, Commending also those States, particularly the least developed and those hosting millions of refugees over long periods of time, which, despite severe economic, development and environmental challenges of their own, continue to admit large numbers of refugees into their territories, and emphasizing the need to share the burden of those States to the maximum extent possible through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection has continued to increase and that their protection continues to be seriously jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission, unlawful expulsion, refoulement, unjustified detention, other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that, in a number of instances, the internally displaced are present alongside refugees, returnees or a vulnerable local population, in situations where it is neither reasonable nor feasible to treat the categories differently in responding to their needs for assistance and protection, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the High Commissioner to meet the protection and assistance needs of refugee women and children, who constitute the majority of the worldâs refugee population and who are often exposed to serious threats to their safety and well-being, Noting with concern the persistent problems of stateless persons in various regions and the emergence of new situations of statelessness, 1. Strongly reaffirms the fundamental importance of the function of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of providing international protection to refugees and the need for States to cooperate fully with her Office in order to facilitate the effective exercise of that function; 2. Calls upon all States that have not yet done so to accede or declare succession to and to implement fully the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and relevant regional instruments for the protection of refugees; 3. Deplores the fact that in certain situations refugees and returnees and other persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner have been subjected to armed attack, murder, rape and other violations of or threats to their personal security and other fundamental rights and that incidents of refoulement and denial of access to safety have occurred, and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection and the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights norms; 4.
