crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that, in a number of instances, the internally displaced are present alongside refugees, returnees or a vulnerable local population, in situations where it is neither reasonable nor feasible to treat the categories differently in responding to their needs for assistance and protection, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the High Commissioner to meet the protection and assistance needs of refugee

On this principle there is general agreement. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , this principle should be reflected in the Organizationâs functioning in the equal treatment accorded to the official and working languages of the United Nations. It sometimes happens, however, that this essential principle of equality is not respected in the different bodies. Various justifications are cited: financial reasons, the unavailability of interpretation or translation services, the urgent nature of the work at hand, and so on. In the heat of the moment, some delegations may be tempted not to react when asked to waive their right to work in the official language of the Organization chosen by them and to be provided with documentation in that language. In the long term, however, this waiver has a particularly nefarious effect in that it is the embryonic form of a tendency to accept a virtually monolingual United Nations. Far from being simpler, cheaper or better, failure on the Organizationâs part to respect the multilingualism which is its rule and which it should strictly enforce would necessarily lead to the decline and impoverishment of discussions, to the development of stereotypes, to bureaucracy and to a waning of the interest of peoples in the United Nations. It would be wrong, however, to fall into the trap of believing that such a trend is inevitable. All that is required is vigilance to insist at all times that Member States should receive from the Organization the service to which they are entitled under the constitutional texts. This means, in particular, that the Secretariat should make it a rule to employ in its relations with Member States the official language which the latter choose to use. This requirement naturally has implications in terms of the linguistic skills which should rightfully be expected from staff of the United Nations. It may be useful to recall this unequivocally. It is noticeable that the staffing of the interpretation and translation services has not expanded at the same rate as the increase in the activities of the various United Nations bodies over the past few years. As a result, there are delays in making documents available in the official languages and meetings are postponed because of the lack of teams of interpreters. All this hampers the proper functioning of the Organization and gives the impression that the delegations which insist on having the services required for the meaningful practice of multilingualism are troublemakers who are overly intransigent. This is a very serious perversion of the system and the only way to avoid it is for the interpretation and translation services to have staff and resources which, Joes despite budgetary constraints, remain adequate to deal with the increasing workload. The practice of holding ""informal"" meetings without interpretation or circulating ""unofficial"" documents in one language only can in no way be an acceptable solution to these shortcomings. Cultural and linguistic diversity is a responsible choice which the United Nations is perfectly able to make if it exhibits in this regard the far- sightedness and determination that are necessary in order to avoid taking the easy way out. The resolution submitted by the signatories is intended precisely to recall this constant objective, this requirement which is particularly relevant at the dawn of the second fifty years of the Organizationâs existence. APPENDIX Draft resolution Multilingualism The General Assembly , Recalling its resolutions 2 (I) of 1 February 1946, 2241 B (XXI) of 20 December 1966, 2292 (XXII) of 8 December 1967, 2359 B (XXII) of 19 December 1967, 2479 (XXIII) and 2480 B (XXIII) of 21 December 1968, 3189 (XXVIII), 3190 (XXVIII) and 3191 (XXVIII) of 18 December 1973 and 43/224 D of 21 December 1988, Recalling also, on the occasion of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, that the universality of the United Nations and its corollary of multilingualism require each State Member of the Organization, whatever the official or working language in which it expresses itself, to make itself understood just as it should endeavour to understand others, Stressing the need for strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the different bodies and organs of the United Nations, Regretting that unequal use is made of the different working languages and official languages within the United Nations, and desiring that persons recruited by the Organization should have a command of and make use of at least one working language and one official language, Considering that the translation and interpretation budgets of United Nations bodies should be commensurate with requirements and exempt from any restrictive budgetary measures, as recalled in resolution 42/207 C of 11 December 1987, Noting that the principle of equality of the official languages and of the working languages is being called into question with increasing frequency by the holding of so-called ""reduced cost"" informal meetings, 1.

Recalls the need to ensure the simultaneous distribution of these documents in the official and working languages of the Organization; 6. Stresses the usefulness of ensuring that adequate publications and data banks in the different official and working languages are available to the libraries and documentation centres of the various bodies; 7. Requests the delegations of Member States and the Secretariat to limit the holding of informal meetings without interpretation; 8.

As part of its activities, ACTC has entered into relations and concluded agreements with a number of agencies of the United Nations system; these agreements have resulted in cooperative activities in the countries members of ACTC, especially in the following areas: (a) Observation of elections; (b) Strengthening of national and regional institutions in support of the democratic process; (c) Promotion of human rights; (d) Promotion of the rights of the child; (e) Economic development; (Â£) Environment; (g) Energy; (h) Literacy campaigns; (i) Support for educational systems; (3) Protection of heritage. 5. Moreover, through its political organs, namely, the Francophone Conference of Heads of State and Government, the Ministerial Conference of French-speaking Countries and the Permanent Council of French-speaking Countries, ACTC promotes and supports the participation of its member countries in meetings and conferences organized under United Nations auspices. These include the following: (a) World Summit for Children (New York, 1990); (b) United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992); (c) Meetings of negotiating groups on desertification and climate change; (d) World Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993); (e) Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Barbados, 1994); (f) International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994); (g) World Summit for Social Development (Copenhagen, 1994); (h) Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995). 6. The Heads of State and Government that use French as a common language, meeting in Grand-Baie, Mauritius, in October 1993, adopted a special resolution on the French-speaking community and international relations, in which, after having reiterated their solidarity and their firm desire to join efforts to build a better future for their peoples and the international community, expressly affirmed: (a) Their firm commitment that they share with other international bodies efforts to find appropriate solutions to the major political and economic problems of todayâs world; (b) Their determination to develop, within these bodies, as well as at major international conferences, an ongoing in-depth dialogue among the nations of the French-speaking world; (c) Their support for activities to ensure that the French-speaking community maintains a dynamic presence in international affairs, within the framework of a new partnership with all the organizations that make up the United Nations family. 7. It was from its policy of openness and wish to cooperate with international organizations, in particular with the United Nations, that ACTC opened, in 1991, an office at the United Nations Office at Geneva, which provides: (a) A place for meeting and dialogue for French-speaking delegations participating in the many meetings organized by the United Nations in Geneva; (b) A base for French-speaking countries that do not have a permanent mission in Geneva; (c) A place for maintaining liaison with the United Nations Secretariat and partner specialized agencies. ACTC recently opened a similar office at United Nations Headquarters in New York, which also has the task of maintaining liaison with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 8. Sharing the same ideas and pursuing the same objectives of peace, stability and development, the United Nations and ACTC are carrying out complementary activities in a number of areas of common interest. These activities must be strengthened and better coordinated for the benefit of the countries members of ACTC and, by extension, all States Members of the United Nations. To this end, close and regular working relations between the two organizations are advisable.

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people

twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or

reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after

of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 of 23 December 1994 on assistance in mine clearance, both adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the

refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the international community, Recognizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, in

peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof

these fields, Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has an important role in the field of assistance in mine clearance, Noting with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandates of several peace- keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and see solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the

Expresses its appreciation to Member States, United Nations organizations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that participated in the International Meeting on Mine Clearance for their strong expression of cooperation in the field of assistance in mine clearance, and particularly States and regional organizations for their financial contributions to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance as well as for providing the necessary means to establish a de-mining stand-by capacity within the United Nations; 4, Appeals to Member States as well as to intergovernmental organizations and foundations to continue to contribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance and to continue to supply the necessary means to the United Nations to foster its de-mining stand-by capacity; 5.
