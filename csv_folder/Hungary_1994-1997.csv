High Commissioner on 9 November 1994, 3/ Recalling its resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993, Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial importance of the High Commissioner’s functions of providing international protection to refugees and seeking solutions to refugee problems, Welcoming the continuing strong commitment of States to

prevent conditions that might give rise to the flight of refugees, and to address the root causes of refugee outflows, and underlining, in this connection, State responsibility, particularly as it relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries around the world, Commending also those States, particularly the least developed and those hosting millions of refugees over long periods of time, which, despite severe economic, development and environmental challenges of their own, continue to admit large numbers of refugees into their territories, and emphasizing the need to share the burden of those States to the maximum extent possible through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection has continued to increase and that their protection continues to be seriously jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission, unlawful expulsion, refoulement, unjustified detention, other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that, in a number of instances, the internally displaced are present alongside refugees, returnees or a vulnerable local population, in situations where it is neither reasonable nor feasible to treat the categories differently in responding to their needs for assistance and protection, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the High Commissioner to meet the protection and assistance needs of refugee women and children, who constitute the majority of the world’s refugee population and who are often exposed to serious threats to their safety and well-being, Noting with concern the persistent problems of stateless persons in various regions and the emergence of new situations of statelessness, 1.

Calls upon all States that have not yet done so to accede or declare succession to and to implement fully the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and relevant regional instruments for the protection of refugees; 3.

Calls upon all States to uphold asylum as an indispensable instrument for the international protection of refugees, and to respect scrupulously the fundamental principle of non-refoulement; 5. Reiterates the importance of ensuring access, for all persons seeking international protection, to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or, as appropriate, to other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection, while not diminishing the protection afforded to refugees under the terms of the 1951 Convention, the 1967 Protocol and relevant regional instruments; 6. Calls upon all States to assist and support the High Commissioner’s efforts to continue to provide international protection and assistance, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions, to persons who have been forced to flee or to remain outside their countries of origin as a result of danger to their life or freedom owing to situations of conflict, and to seek solutions to the problems arising from their forced displacement; 7.

fundamental freedoms for all, and to prevent violations of such rights, Recalling its past resolutions and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the World Conference on Human Rights, Dismayed by the continuation of the human tragedy addressed in those resolutions and decisions, and by the associated massive and systematic violations of human rights, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, E/CN.4/1995/L. 88 page 2 Repelled by the odious practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", directed principally against the Bosnian population, and emphasizing once again the right of all its victims to return to their homes in safety and dignity, the invalidity of forcible territorial gains and of forced transfers of property and other acts under duress, Deeply concerned that rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women and children continue to be used as a deliberate instrument of war and ""ethnic cleansing"", particularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dismayed by the number of missing persons still unaccounted for, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, and noting in this regard the report of the expert member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances on the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia (E/CN.4/1995/37), Deeply concerned about the situation of human rights in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo but also in Sandjak and in Vojvodina, and about the situation of the Bulgarian minority, Noting with special appreciation the continuing efforts of the Special Rapporteur and those under his direction, both in field offices and at the Centre for Human Rights, and regretting that the Special Rapporteur still has not been allowed to open an office in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Grateful for the work of the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights and of all those involved in the humanitarian relief effort, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the officers and personnel of the United Nations Protection Force, Noting with interest the meeting convened on 3 February 1995 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, after consultation with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, to develop, in close coordination with other United Nations bodies operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a coordinated and more effective response to human rights requirements in that country (E/CN.4/1995/98, para. 31) E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 3 Sustained by the international community’s continued determination to bring a peaceful, just and lasting resolution to the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, and supporting the continuing efforts of all who seek to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Welcoming especially in this regard the efforts of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, its Co-Chairmen and Steering Committee, Welcoming in particular the efforts undertaken by representatives of the international community to assist the parties in reaching a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to achieve a cease-fire, the signature of an economic agreement and the eventual resolution of the political situation in Croatia, as well as the role played by the United Nations Protection Force under very difficult circumstances, the activities of the European Commission Monitoring Mission and the European Union administration of Mostar, the constitutional provisions for the protection of human rights and other aspects of the Federation agreements of Washington and Vienna, and other proposals which could, if accepted by all parties, lead to a substantial improvement in the human rights situation of members of all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Welcoming in this regard the signature of the comprehensive cease-fire agreement on 23 December 1994, in which the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities agreed to protect the human rights of those persons residing within the territory under their control in accordance with international standards, to prompt and unconditional release of all detainees, including prisoners of war, and to release all available information on missing persons, and of the Agreement on Complete Cessation of Hostilities signed on 31 December 1994, in which the same parties also agreed to ensure full freedom of movement for the United Nations Protection Force and other international agencies in order to implement the agreement, to monitor human rights and to deliver humanitarian aid, 1.  Commends and thanks the Special Rapporteur for his continued tenacity in fulfilling his mandate under the most trying circumstances, and for the light shed by his important reports, in particular his latest reports (E/CN.4/1995/54 and Corr.1, E/CN.4/1995/57) and notes that his continuing activity can be a force to reduce human rights violations in the region; E/CN.4/1995/L. 88 page 4 2.

Reaffirms the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to find peaceful solutions through negotiations and fully to protect human rights at all times; 4. Condemns categorically all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all sides and, while recognizing that primary responsibility for most of these violations is borne by the leadership in territory under Serb control and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), notes that violations have been committed by all of the parties to the conflict; 5. Demands immediate, firm and resolute action by the international community to stop all human rights violations, to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to bring those responsible to trial; 6. Expresses alarm at the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur that nationalistic rhetoric and sweeping attacks and slurs against other national groups have been a dominant feature of reports propagated in some media in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina but especially in a systematic way by most media of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and particularly media under the control of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities, as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur, and of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities in parts of the Republic of Croatia, and that this phenomenon has led directly to the commission of fearful atrocities on the battlefields and throughout the territory, underlines in this regard the importance of ensuring the existence of independent media, and calls for immediate action by each Government to implement the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur in this regard (E/CN.4/1995/54, paras. 211-216); 7. Again denounces continued deliberate and unlawful attacks and use of military force against civilians and other protected persons by all sides, recognizing that the primary though not the sole responsibility lies with the Serbian forces; 8. Condemns the continuation, particularly in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor and Bijeljina, of the heinous and illegitimate acts identified by the E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 5 Special Rapporteur as elements of ""ethnic cleansing"", while commending the courage and sacrifice of the many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations, and urges the international community to use all its influence on the parties, in particular the authorities in parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under Serbian control and occupation, to end it immediately and to reverse its effects; 9. Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver umanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 10. Renews its expression of outrage at the use of the systematic practice of rape as a weapon of war against women and children and as an instrument of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the areas of armed conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and again recognizes that rape in these circumstances constitutes a war crime; 12. Welcomes in this connection the expanding activities of the International Tribunal established pursuant to Security Council resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, and in this context requests States, as a matter of urgency, to make available to the International Tribunal resources, services and expert personnel, including experts in the prosecution of crimes of sexual violence, as recommended by the General Assembly, and encourages voluntary contributions from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations so that the Tribunal may conduct without any further delay its stipulated functions of trying those accused of and punishing those responsible for violations of international law; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 6 13.

Requests all States, as required under Security Council resolution 827 (1993), to cooperate with the International Tribunal in providing information and evidence for investigations and trials and in the apprehension and surrender of persons accused of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; 16. Again urges the Special Rapporteur, all United Nations bodies, including the United Nations Protection Force and the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, specialized agencies, Governments and informed intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate fully with the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal and provide him on a continuing basis with all relevant and accurate information in their possession related to his task; 17. Demands the immediate internationally supervised release of all persons arbitrarily or otherwise illegally detained and the immediate closure of all places of detention not authorized by and in compliance with the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto; 18. Reiterates its demand that all parties immediately notify the International Committee of the Red Cross of the locations of all camps, prisons and other places of detention, and that there be immediate, unimpeded and continued access to such places by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Special Rapporteur and other relevant international and regional organizations; 19.

Requests the Governments of Croatia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue and expand their cooperation with the special process, and strongly urges the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to begin promptly such cooperation by inviting the expert to visit the country and by disclosing all relevant available information and documentation in order finally to determine the fate of thousands of missing persons and to alleviate the suffering of their relatives; 22. Requests the Secretary-General to continue providing the special process with the necessary resources, from within available resources of the regular budget of the United Nations, so that it is enabled to perform its functions continuously and expeditiously; 23. Expresses its grave concern at the continued deterioration of the human rights situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), particularly in Kosovo, as described by the Special Rapporteur, and again condemns the violations of human rights occurring there, including police brutality, arbitrary killings, searches, seizures and arrests, torture and ill-treatment, the closure of Albanian secondary schools and the Albanian University, the elimination of the Albanian language in public administration and services, mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians, discriminatory laws and the attempt to change the ethnic structure of Kosovo, as well as prevention of the return of Albanians from abroad; 24. Again demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, recalling that the best means to prevent the possible escalation of the conflict is to safeguard human rights, restore genuine autonomy and establish democratic institutions in Kosovo; 25. Expresses its grave concern at renewed reports of violations of human rights in Sandjak and in Vojvodina and concerning members of the Bulgarian minority, as noted by the Special Rapporteur, while commending the courage and sacrifice of many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 8 26. Urges all parties in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, to engage in a substantive dialogue, under the auspices of, among others, the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, to act with the utmost restraint and to settle disputes peacefully and with full respect for human rights; 27.

Welcomes the efforts by the Governments of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to uphold human rights in their territories, urges them to fulfil the human rights commitments they have made, and in particular asks the Republic of Croatia to eliminate the arbitrary practices on the part of the Croatian authorities, as reported by the Special Rapporteur; 30. Condemns the continuation of ""ethnic cleansing"" in areas under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities in the United Nations Protected Areas; recommendations have not been fully implemented, in some cases because of resistance by the parties on the ground, and again strongly urges the parties, all States and relevant organizations to give immediate consideration to them; 32.

Emphasizes that such forms of alternative service should be of a non-combatant or civilian character, in the public interest and not of a punitive nature; 7. Recognizes that some States accept claims of conscientious objection as valid without inquiry, and appeals to Member States that do not have such a system to establish, within the framework of their national legal system, independent and impartial decision-making bodies with the task of determining whether a conscientious objection is valid in a specific case; 8. Affirms the importance of the availability of information about the right to conscientious objection to military service, and the means of acquiring conscientious objector status, to all relevant persons affected by military service; 9.

export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting that according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Assistance in mine clearance"", 1/ it is estimated that there are more than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons, Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 A of 23 December 1994, calling for assistance in mine clearance, Welcoming the programmes of assistance which exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines, Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine

initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 2/ Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land- mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1.  Welcomes the moratoria already declared by certain States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines; 2.

further deterioration in the situation of human rights and that its purpose may be to change the demographic composition of Kosovo, Noting with anguish the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, in particular his seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth periodic reports (E/CN.4/1995/4, E/CN.4/1995/10, A/49/641-S/1994/1252,

Strongly condemns the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur in his reports, most of which are committed in connection with the systematic policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocidal acts in the areas of the former Yugoslavia under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities, and which include mass killing, torture, disappearances, rape, and other sexual abuses against women and children, use of civilians as human shields on confrontation lines and as mine clearers, arbitrary executions, destruction of houses, religious objects and cultural and historical heritage, forced and illegal evictions, detentions, arbitrary searches and other acts of violence; 4.

Condemns the continuation, particularly in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor and Bijeljina, of the heinous and illegitimate acts identified by the Special Rapporteur as elements of ""ethnic cleansing"", while commending the courage and sacrifice of the many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations, and urges the international community to use all its influence on the parties, in particular the authorities in parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under Serbian control and occupation, to end it immediately and to reverse its effects; 17. Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver humanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 18.

APPLICATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO DATA MESSAGES Article 5 Legal recognition of data messages Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of a data message. Article 6 Writing 1.  Where the law requires information to be in writing, that requirement is met by a data message if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 2. Paragraph 1 applies whether the requirement therein is in the form of an obligation or whether the law simply provides consequences for the information not being in writing. 3. The provisions of this article do not apply to the following: [...]. Article 7 Signature 1.  Where the law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met in relation to a data message if: (a) A method is used to identify that person and to indicate that person’s approval of the information contained in the data message; and (b) That method is as reliable as was appropriate for the purpose for which the data message was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement. 2.

In the context of contract formation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of data messages.

As between the originator and the addressee, an addressee is entitled to regard a data message as being that of the originator, and to act on that assumption, if: (a) In order to ascertain whether the data message was that of the originator, the addressee properly applied a procedure previously agreed to by the originator for that purpose; or (b) The data message as received by the addressee resulted from the actions of a person whose relationship with the originator or with any agent of the originator enabled that person to gain access to a method used by the originator to identify data messages as its own. 4. Paragraph 3 does not apply: (a) As of the time when the addressee has both received notice from the originator that the data message is not that of the originator, and had reasonable time to act accordingly; or (b) In a case within paragraph 3 (b), at any time when the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was not that of the originator. 5. Where a data message is that of the originator or is deemed to be that of the originator, or the addressee is entitled to act on that assumption, then, as between the originator and the addressee, the addressee is entitled to regard the data message as received as being what the originator intended to send, and to act on that assumption. The addressee is not so entitled when it knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the transmission resulted in any error in the data message as received. 6. The addressee is entitled to regard each data message received as a separate data message and to act on that assumption, except to the extent that it duplicates another data message and the addressee knew or should have known, had it exercised reasonable care or used any agreed procedure, that the data message was a duplicate. Article 14 Acknowledgement of receipt 1.  Paragraphs 2 to 4 of this article apply where, on or before sending a data message, or by means of that data message, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the data message be acknowledged. 2. Where the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may be given by: (a) Any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or (b) Any conduct of the addressee, sufficient to indicate to the originator that the data message has been received. 3. Where the originator has stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, the data message is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received. 4. Where the originator has not stated that the data message is conditional on receipt of the acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time the originator: (a) May give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and (b) If the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified in subparagraph (a), may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the data message as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights it may have. 5. Where the originator receives the addressee’s acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed that the related data message was received by the addressee. That presumption does not imply that the data message corresponds to the message received. 6. Where the received acknowledgement states that the related data message met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in applicable standards, it is presumed that those requirements have been met. 7. Except insofar as it relates to the sending or receipt of the data message, this article is not intended to deal with the legal consequences that may flow either from that data message or from the acknowledgement of its receipt. Article 15 Time and place of dispatch and receipt of data message 1.  Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows: (a) If the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs: (i) At the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or (ii) If the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee; (b) If the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee. 3. Paragraph 2 applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system is located may be different from the place where the data message is deemed to be received under paragraph 4. 4. Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business. For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) If the originator or the addressee has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction or, where there is no underlying transaction, the principal place of business; (b) If the originator or the addressee does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to its habitual residence. 5.

complex factors, which may include human rights violations, political, ethnic and economic conflicts, famine, insecurity, violence, poverty and environmental degradation, which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system-wide response, particularly at the international and regional levels, Noting that the Secretary-General, in his report entitled “An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277-S/24111), identifies the protection of human rights and the promotion of economic well-being as important elements of peace, security and

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, aimed at making effective the fundamental right of refugees to return to their own countries in safety and dignity, Recognizing that the human rights machinery of the United Nations, including the mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights and the human rights treaty bodies, has important capabilities to address human rights violations which cause movements of refugees and displaced persons or prevent durable solutions to their plight, Convinced that the activities of these mechanisms, with a view, inter alia, to preventing mass exoduses and to strengthening emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, should be encouraged and further developed and coordinated at the international, regional and country levels, with priority given to the systematization of the early-warning information collection, Recognizing that women and children constitute the majority of most refugee populations and that, in addition to the problems they share in common with all refugees, women and girls in such circumstances are vulnerable to gender-based discrimination and gender-specific violence and exploitation, Recalling that States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees undertake, under article 35, to provide information to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the implementation of the Convention, as was recalled in the General Conclusion on International Protection adopted by the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High
