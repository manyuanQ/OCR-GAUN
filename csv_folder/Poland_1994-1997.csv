crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissionerâs crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the

Commission at its forty-eighth session by the Permanent Mission of the Gambia to the United Nations (E/CN.4/1992/82), Concerned that lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental rights by persons suffering from economic, social or legal disadvantage heightens their vulnerability to the risk of HIV infection, Noting that, according to a report submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of

rights, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, E/CN.4/1995/L. 88 page 2 Repelled by the odious practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", directed principally against the Bosnian population, and emphasizing once again the right of all its victims to return to their homes in safety and dignity, the invalidity of forcible territorial gains and of forced transfers of property and other acts under duress, Deeply concerned that rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women and children continue to be used as a deliberate instrument of war and ""ethnic cleansing"", particularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dismayed by the number of missing persons still unaccounted for, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, and noting in this regard the report of the expert member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances on the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia (E/CN.4/1995/37),

and of all those involved in the humanitarian relief effort, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the officers and personnel of the United Nations Protection Force, Noting with interest the meeting convened on 3 February 1995 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, after consultation with the

human rights requirements in that country (E/CN.4/1995/98, para. 31) E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 3 Sustained by the international communityâs continued determination to bring a peaceful, just and lasting resolution to the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, and supporting the continuing efforts of all who seek to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Welcoming especially in this regard the efforts of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, its Co-Chairmen and Steering Committee, Welcoming in particular the efforts undertaken by representatives of the international community to assist the parties in reaching a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to achieve a cease-fire, the signature of an economic agreement and the eventual resolution of the political situation in Croatia, as well as the role played by the United Nations Protection Force under very difficult circumstances, the activities of the European Commission Monitoring Mission and the European Union administration of Mostar, the constitutional provisions for the protection of human rights and other aspects of the Federation agreements of Washington and Vienna, and other proposals which could, if accepted by all parties, lead to a substantial improvement in the human rights situation of members of all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Welcoming in this regard the signature of the comprehensive cease-fire agreement on 23 December 1994, in which the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities agreed to protect the human rights of those persons residing within the territory under their control in accordance with international standards, to prompt and unconditional release of all detainees, including prisoners of war, and to release all available information on missing persons, and of the Agreement on Complete Cessation of

Demands immediate, firm and resolute action by the international community to stop all human rights violations, to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to bring those responsible to trial; 6.

Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver umanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 10.

Again demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, recalling that the best means to prevent the possible escalation of the conflict is to safeguard human rights, restore genuine autonomy and establish democratic institutions in Kosovo; 25. Expresses its grave concern at renewed reports of violations of human rights in Sandjak and in Vojvodina and concerning members of the Bulgarian minority, as noted by the Special Rapporteur, while commending the courage and sacrifice of many Serbs who continue to refuse to take part in such violations; E/CN.4/1995/L.88 page 8 26. Urges all parties in Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, to engage in a substantive dialogue, under the auspices of, among others, the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, to act with the utmost restraint and to settle disputes peacefully and with full respect for human rights; 27.

(E) 121095 121095 Joes 2. In this World Year of Peopleâs Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression. 3. We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6.

refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the international community, Recognizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, in accordance with international law, Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, the health and the lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof

of mine clearance needs to improve substantially if the global land-mine problem is to be effectively tackled, Recalling its resolution 50/74 of 12 December 1995 on the Convention on Prohibitions or

Herzegovina established by the Washington Agreement of 18 March 1994, which also constitutes a democratic model for the reconciliation of all peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the territory of the
