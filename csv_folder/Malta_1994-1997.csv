A/49/234 English Page 2 ANNEX Explanatory memorandum Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has shown a continuing interest in the study of the question of capital punishment, with a view to promoting full respect for everyoneâs right to life, and has taken various initiatives aiming at reaching the ultimate goal of abolishing the death penalty in all countries. Among these is","General Assembly resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which the Assembly adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The question of capital punishment has become particularly urgent in recent times, in view of the continuing high number of death sentences and executions in various parts of the world. On 4 October 1994, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution in which it underlined this urgency and asked all States that had not yet abolished capital punishment to do so rapidly. We also would like to recall the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 March 1992 pointing in the same direction. In accordance with such a line, our countries have decided to promote appropriate action within the United Nations, aiming at contributing to an eventual abolition of capital punishment. This initiative reflects the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of our peoples, who are firmly opposed to the imposition of the death penalty anywhere in the world. Therefore, we would like to request the inclusion of the question of capital punishment in the agenda of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, and to this end submit the attached resolution. In our view, the Third Committee is the most appropriate forum in which to consider the question of capital punishment. We therefore recommend that the proposed item be assigned to the Third Committee. APPENDIX Draft resolution The General Assembly , Recalling article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms everyoneâs right to life, Recalling its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971 and 32/61 of 8 December 1977, as well as resolution 44/128 of 15 December 1989, by which it adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolutions 1574 (L) of 20 May 1971, 1745 (LIV) of 16 May 1973, 1930 (LVIII) of 6 May 1975, 1985/33 of 29 May 1985, 1990/29 of 24 May 1990 and 1990/51 of 24 July 1990, Deeply concerned about the fact that capital punishment is still retained and used for ordinary crimes by a consistent number of Member States and that several countries impose the death penalty in disregard of the safeguards provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for juveniles and pregnant women, Commending the fact that both in the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, established by the Security Council in its resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, and in the statute for an international criminal court, elaborated by the International Law Commission, capital punishment is excluded from the penalties that these courts are authorized to impose, Believing that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights, 1. Calls upon all Governments in a position to do so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Invites all States, referring to its resolutions 2857 (XXVI) and 32/61, to consider the progressive restriction of the number of offences for which the death penalty may be imposed and the exclusion of juveniles and pregnant women from capital executions; 3.

Also encourages all States to consider the opportunity of instituting moratoria on pending executions, with a view to ensuring that the principle that no State should dispose of the life of any human being is affirmed in every part of the world by the year 2000.",10/25/1994,1994_163939,Malta,"@) General Assembly oiste, ââ 3GENERALA/49/234 25 October 1994ORIGINAL: ENGLISHForty-ninth sessionREQUEST FOR THE INCLUSION OF AN ADDITIONAL ITEM IN THE AGENDA OF THE FORTY-NINTH SESSIONCAPITAL PUNISHMENTLetter dated 21 October 1994 from the Permanent",yes

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people

prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after

of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 of 23 December 1994 on assistance in mine clearance, both adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the international community, Recognizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, in accordance with international law, Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, the health and the lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof and the lack of global coordination in the field of research to improve mine-clearance technology and the urgent need to foster international technical cooperation in this field, Aware that the rate of mine clearance needs to improve substantially if the global land-mine problem is to be effectively tackled, Recalling its resolution 50/74 of 12 December 1995 on the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects 2/ and the convening by the Secretary-General of the Review

these fields, Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has an important role in the field of assistance in mine clearance, Noting with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandates of several peace- keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and see solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the Secretary-General through the work of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat in increasing public awareness of the problem of land-mines and for the establishment of the Central Land-mine Database and its inventories of mine-awareness materials and mine- clearance techniques, Commending in particular the outcome of the International Meeting on Mine Clearance held at Geneva

Expresses its appreciation to Member States, United Nations organizations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that participated in the International Meeting on Mine Clearance for their strong expression of cooperation in the field of assistance in mine clearance, and particularly States and regional organizations for their financial contributions to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance as well as for providing the necessary means to establish a de-mining stand-by capacity within the United Nations; 4, Appeals to Member States as well as to intergovernmental organizations and foundations to continue to contribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance and to continue to supply the necessary means to the United Nations to foster its de-mining stand-by capacity; 5. Invites all relevant multilateral and national programmes and bodies to include, in coordination with the United Nations, activities related to mine clearance in their humanitarian, social and economic assistance activities; 6. Emphasizes again, in this connection, the importance of coordination by the United Nations of activities related to mine clearance, including those by regional organizations, in particular activities related to information and training; 7.
