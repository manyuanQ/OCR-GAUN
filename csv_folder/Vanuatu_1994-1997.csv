which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting that according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Assistance in mine clearance"", 1/ it is estimated that there are more than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons, Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 A of 23 December 1994, calling for assistance in mine clearance, Welcoming the programmes of assistance which exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines, Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine

initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 2/ Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land- mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1. Welcomes the moratoria already declared by certain States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines; 2. Urges States that have not yet done so to declare such moratoria at the earliest possible date; 3.
