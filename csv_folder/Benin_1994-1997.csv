The First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Manila, the Philippines, in June 1988. Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E. Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3. The Conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the exchange of experiences initiated in Manila; it also recognized the value of democracy as an integral part of political processes for the reconciliation and development of national societies and for peace and security in the international community within a broader and comprehensive concept of security. 4. In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly , to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7.

The co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS represents an internationally coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The programme comprises the following United Nations system organizations: the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank. The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization (resolution EB93.R5) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (resolution 144EX-5. 1. 5), and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: E/1994/L.18/Rev.1 I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13. Funding for country-level activities will be obtained primarily through existing fund-raising mechanisms of the co-sponsors. These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/20/1994,1994_191736,Benin,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.

The co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS represents an internationally coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The programme comprises the following United Nations system organizations: the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank. The programme has been formally endorsed by the Executive Boards of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the other four co-sponsors have also committed themselves to full participation. 2. The fundamental characteristics that define the programme are as follows: I. OBJECTIVES 3. The objectives of the programme are to: (a) Provide global leadership in response to the epidemic; (b) Achieve and promote global consensus on policy and programmatic approaches; (c) Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system to monitor trends and ensure that appropriate and effective policies and strategies are implemented at the country level; (d) Strengthen the capacity of national Governments to develop comprehensive national strategies, and implement effective HIV/AIDS activities at the country level; (e) Promote broad-based political and social mobilization to prevent and respond to HIV/AIDS within countries, ensuring that national responses involve a wide range of sectors and institutions; (f) Advocate greater political commitment in responding to the epidemic at the global and country levels, including the mobilization and allocation of adequate resources for HIV/AIDS-related activities. 4. In fulfilling these objectives, the programme will collaborate with national Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, and United Nations system organizations. II. CO-SPONSORSHIP 5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a global concern. Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their own HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. E/1994/L.18 the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13. Funding for country-level activities will be obtained primarily through existing fund-raising mechanisms of the co-sponsors. These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/15/1994,1994_193331,Benin,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.

Development proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 2542 (XXIV) of 11 December 1969 and the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, Bearing in mind resolutions 1989/20 and 1989/21 of 31 August 1989, 1990/16 of 30 August 1990, 1991/27 of 29 August 1991, 1992/29 of 27 August 1992, 1993/40 of 26 August 1993 and 1994/40 of 26 August 1994 of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Recognizing that the activities of the various organizations in the United Nations system should be closely interrelated and that it is necessary to draw on all the efforts made in the various disciplines relating to the human person in order to promote all human rights effectively, Having in mind the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and the Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s, adopted by the World Summit for Children on 30 September 1990, Aware that the serious problem of foreign debt remains one of the most acute factors adversely affecting economic and social development and the living standards of the inhabitants in many developing countries, with serious effects of a social nature, Concerned about the repercussions of structural adjustment programmes in the realization and full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, Recognizing the need to address the obstacles that impede the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights all over the world, Aware of the fact that the Working Group on the Right to Development identified the problem of foreign debt as one of the obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, Deeply concerned that the debt-service obligations remain high, that the factors determining the capacity to pay have not moved in consonance with the E/CN.4/1995/L.18/Rev.1 page 3 debt-service obligations of the majority of developing countries and that the prospects for reducing the adverse effects of the debt burden on the development process in developing countries continue to be uncertain, Noting that developing countries still meet their debt obligations at considerable cost to their economies, Noting with regret the negative effects of the policies adopted to face situations of external debt on the realization and enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, Stressing that the present international economic order continues to be unfair and needs to be transformed, Stressing also that measures for debt reduction need to be accompanied by vigorous measures aimed at improving the international economic environment in order to facilitate the growth and development of developing countries, Considering that the new strategies for solving the debt problem, of both official and private origin, require policies of economic adjustment accompanied by growth and development and that it is essential, within those policies, to give priority consideration in their implementation to human conditions, including standards of living, health, food, education and employment of the population, especially among the most vulnerable and low-income groups, Taking into account the particular concern expressed by the General Assembly at the growing deterioration of living conditions in the developing world, at its negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, and especially at the very serious economic situation of the African continent and at the terrible effects of the heavy burden of external debt on the developing countries, Recalling its

Also stresses the need to implement additional debt-reduction measures, including further cancellation or reduction of part of the official debt or debt-service, and the adoption of more urgent actions with regard to the commercial and multilateral debt owed by developing countries taking into account, in particular, the needs of debtor countries; 4. Emphasizes that, in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction, there is a need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries, and urges the creditor countries and the multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance in order to support the implementation by the developing countries of their economic reform programmes, so as to enable them to achieve adequate technological and productive progress and extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving economic growth and development and to compensate in some measure the developing countries which meet their obligations at considerable cost to their economies; 5. Affirms that debt payments should not take precedence over the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, shelter, clothing, employment, health services and a healthy environment; 6. Requests the Working Group on the Right to Development to continue to pay particular attention in its deliberations to the social repercussions of the policies adopted to face situations of external debt on the effective enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and to make recommendations in this regard; 7.

Considers that in order to find a durable solution to the debt crisis of developing countries and in addition to technical measures that should be implemented in order to alleviate the debt burden of those countries, there is a need for a political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries in the United Nations system, based on the principle of E/CN.4/1995/L.18/Rev.1 page 5 shared responsibility, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to recommend ways and means to carry out this dialogue, and to submit a report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second session; 12.
