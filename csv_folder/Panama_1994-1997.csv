activities of her Office 1/ and the report of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner on the work of its forty-fifth session, 2/ and taking note of the statement made by the High Commissioner on 9 November 1994, 3/ Recalling its resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993, Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements, as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems, which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner’s crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight, Reaffirming the importance of the 1951 Convention 4/ and the 1967 Protocol 5/ relating to the Status of Refugees as the cornerstone of the international system for the protection of refugees, and noting with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty seven States are now parties to one or both instruments, Reaffirming the purely humanitarian and non-political character of the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as the crucial importance of the High Commissioner’s functions of providing international protection to refugees and seeking solutions to refugee problems, Welcoming the continuing strong commitment of States to provide protection and assistance to refugees and the valuable support extended by Governments to the High Commissioner in carrying out her humanitarian tasks, Also welcoming the strong commitment made by States, in the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development, 6/ held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994, to the institution of asylum and to refugees and displaced persons, Emphasizing the need for States to assist the High Commissioner in seeking durable and timely solutions to the problems of refugees, and to take part in efforts to prevent conditions that might give rise to the flight of refugees, and to address the root causes of refugee outflows, and underlining, in this connection, State responsibility, particularly as it relates to countries of origin, Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent, courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities, paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered their lives in the course of their duties, and noting with profound regret the deaths of staff members as a consequence of violent events in several countries around the world, Commending also those States, particularly the least developed and those hosting millions of refugees over long periods of time, which, despite severe economic, development and environmental challenges of their own, continue to admit large numbers of refugees into their territories, and emphasizing the need to share the burden of those States to the maximum extent possible through international assistance, including development-oriented assistance and assistance related to the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, Noting with concern that the number of refugees and other persons to whom the Office of the High Commissioner is called upon to provide assistance and protection has continued to increase and that their protection continues to be seriously jeopardized in many situations as a result of denial of admission, unlawful expulsion, refoulement, unjustified detention, other threats to their personal security, dignity and well-being and failure to respect and ensure their fundamental freedoms and human rights, Recognizing that, in certain regions, the misuse by individuals of asylum procedures jeopardizes the institution of asylum and adversely affects the prompt and effective protection of refugees, Noting that the involuntary displacement of persons within their own countries remains a problem of grave humanitarian concern, and that the many and varied underlying causes of involuntary internal displacement and of refugee movements are similar in numerous cases, Recognizing that actions by the international community, in consultation and coordination with the State concerned, on behalf of the internally displaced may contribute to the easing of tensions and the resolution of problems resulting in displacement, and constitute important components of a comprehensive approach to the prevention and solution of refugee problems, Noting that, in a number of instances, the internally displaced are present alongside refugees, returnees or a vulnerable local population, in situations where it is neither reasonable nor feasible to treat the categories differently in responding to their needs for assistance and protection, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the High Commissioner to meet the protection and assistance needs of refugee women and children, who constitute the majority of the world’s refugee population and who are often exposed to serious threats to their safety and well-being, Noting with concern the persistent problems of stateless persons in various regions and the emergence of new situations of statelessness, 1.

Calls upon all States to assist and support the High Commissioner’s efforts to continue to provide international protection and assistance, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions, to persons who have been forced to flee or to remain outside their countries of origin as a result of danger to their life or freedom owing to situations of conflict, and to seek solutions to the problems arising from their forced displacement; 7. Recognizes the desirability of exploring further measures to ensure international protection to all who need it, including temporary protection and other forms of asylum oriented towards repatriation, in situations of conflict or persecution involving large-scale outflows and in which return home is considered the most appropriate durable solution, and encourages the High Commissioner to continue to promote international cooperation and to engage in further consultations and discussions concerning measures to achieve this objective, acknowledging the value of regional arrangements in this regard; 8. Stresses the importance of international solidarity and burden-sharing in reinforcing the international protection of refugees, and urges all States, and relevant non-governmental organizations, in conjunction with the Office of the High Commissioner, to cooperate in efforts to lighten the burden borne by States that have received large numbers of asylum-seekers and refugees; 9. Reiterates that voluntary repatriation, when it is feasible, is the ideal solution to refugee problems, calls upon countries of origin, countries of asylum, the Office of the High Commissioner and the international community as a whole to do everything possible to enable refugees to exercise freely their right to return home in safety and dignity, ensuring that international protection continues to be extended until that time, and assisting, where needed, the return and reintegration of repatriating refugees, and further calls upon the High Commissioner, in cooperation with States concerned, to promote, facilitate and coordinate the voluntary repatriation of refugees, including the monitoring of their safety and well-being on return; 10. Calls for a more concerted response by the international community to the needs of internally displaced persons and, in accordance with its resolution 48/116, reaffirms its support for the High Commissioner’s efforts, on the basis of specific requests from the Secretary-General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations and with the consent of the State concerned, and taking into account the complementarities of the mandates and expertise of other relevant organizations, to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to such persons, emphasizing that activities on behalf of internally displaced persons must not undermine the institution of asylum, including the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution; 12. Calls, likewise, upon States and all parties to conflicts to take all necessary measures to ensure impartial, safe and timely humanitarian access to persons in need of protection and assistance; 13.

Encourages the High Commissioner to continue to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training, legal awareness and education and, in particular, in the area of reproductive health, with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees, in conformity with universally recognized international human rights; 20. Calls upon States to assist the High Commissioner to fulfil her responsibilities, under General Assembly resolution 3274 (XXIX) of 10 December 1974, with respect to the reduction of statelessness, including the promotion of accessions to and full implementation of international instruments relating to statelessness; 22. Reaffirms the importance of incorporating environmental considerations into the programmes of the Office of the High Commissioner, especially in the least developed countries which have hosted refugees over long periods of time, in view of the impact on the environment of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner; 23.

Representatives of 13 countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America attended that Conference. In June 1992, the Government of Nicaragua, under its President H.E.

The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives. The Conference, which was attended by 74 States, adopted the Managua Declaration and a Plan of Action. 3.

In the Managua Declaration, the Conference expressed the conviction that a sound democratic and pluralistic system based on the principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international covenants and conventions on human rights is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, political and civil liberties and equal opportunities. 5. In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6. In the Plan of Action, the Conference agreed to request the Secretary- General of the United Nations, in accordance with established procedures, at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to undertake a study on ways in which the United Nations system could support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. 7.

THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM  The reorganization of the Central American integration process resulted in the Tegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American States (OCAS), a/ signed on 13 December 199","1.  This Protocol established the Central American Integration System (SICA), which began operations on 1 February 1993. The new vision of Central American development sees SICA as the regional organization best equipped to meet current needs, since its objectives and principles reflect political, social, economic and cultural conditions in the Central American countries, as well as the traditions and deepest aspirations of their peoples. Moreover, SICA was designed on the basis of past experience in terms of economic integration and the crisis of the 1980s, the peace process which has the support of the Central American people and the changes introduced in national constitutions with a view to fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, as well as the comprehensive development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. b/ This new regional situation, epitomized by SICA, is that of a more open, stable and democratic Central America. More open, because in addition to reaffirming our ties with the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), we have devised mechanisms and strategies for broadening and intensifying the region’s participation in the international arena. More stable, because we now have definite, clearly formulated objectives and principles to steer the course of regional action and of political thinking and decision-making in Central America. These objectives and principles are spelled out in the Tegucigalpa Protocol to guide the search for ways to ensure the overall well-being and sustainable development of Central Americans; they include the goal of fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development in Central America, whose security will be based primarily on the strengthening of civilian government, the elimination of extreme poverty, the promotion of sustained development, protection of the environment and the eradication of corruption, violence, terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms. To achieve that objective, the fundamental and legitimate basis for all regional actions must be protection of, respect for and promotion of human rights. Without that underpinning, the legal and political structure of SICA would have no foundation or purpose. With the institution of SICA, integration is no longer sectoral — that is, commercial and economic — but comprehensive, meaning that it extends to the economic, social, cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development. Consequently, SICA comprises four sub-systems: economic, social, cultural and political. Environmental conservation and the building of a new ecological order in the region is another objective of the System and constitutes the basic pillar of the comprehensive human development strategy known as the Alliance for Sustainable Development. Thus, the general coordination of all of these sub-systems is the linchpin of integration efforts, and has been entrusted to the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and, on an ongoing basis, to the General Secretariat of SICA. These bodies follow up on regional decisions and policies, prepare documentation for political decision-making and ensure the proper observance and implementation of the Tegucigalpa Protocol. The immediate objective of this overall coordination, which is carried out jointly and with due respect for each sub-system’s functional autonomy, is to guarantee development, as well as unity and coherence in Central American intraregional activities and in relations with third States, groups of States and international organizations. The Meeting of Central American Presidents is the supreme organ of SICA with respect to decisions concerning development, freedom, peace and security. These decisions are followed up by the Councils of Ministers and the General Secretariat, which is also the Permanent Secretariat of the Meeting of Central American Presidents, and by the specialized technical secretariats, with the support of the integration institutions of the different sub-systems. The Meeting of Vice-Presidents acts as an advisory and consultancy organ for the Meeting of Presidents. Another main body is the Central American Parliament, which acts as an organ for exposition, analysis and recommendation under its Constituent Treaty. In order to institute legal safeguards to preserve the rule of law in the region, the Central American Court of Justice was established to guarantee respect for the Tegucigalpa Protocol and its supplementary instruments and acts pursuant to it. The Court is the main judicial organ of SICA. To strengthen the chances of success of regional action by making it consistent, lasting and reliable and by responding to the deeply felt needs and fully recognized aspirations of Central Americans, SICA has a Consultative Committee which provides a forum for the democratic and institutional participation of the community, at the level of private or non-governmental institutions organized regionally in Central America. Regarding the significance of SICA, on 15 June 1994, in their joint declaration to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, the Presidents of the Central American States said the following: Thanks to the will of its peoples and Governments, Central America has established a firm and lasting peace based upon dialogue, democracy, justice and reconciliation. Thus, it has overcome a crisis which originated in the region itself, but was exacerbated by the cold war and the confrontation between the super-Powers. The fruits of that effort can now be seen in improved levels of stability and in the creation and implementation of the Central American Integration System (SICA), accompanied by the consolidation of democratic institutions born of the free expression of the will of the people in fair and open elections. This auspicious situation places Central America in an exceptional position among those regions of the world which have, during the past 10 years, gone through a difficult process of democratic transition. It also enables our region to move forward from an agenda for peace towards an agenda for sustainable human development, which is the main objective that our peoples must pursue in the interests of guaranteeing continued progress. This position was reiterated at the fifteenth Meeting of Presidents of Central America, in Guacimo, Costa Rica, on 20 August 1994 when they stated that: c/ ""Central America has changed. In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement, Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region; democracies have been established and transformed; respect for human rights has been strengthened, and the new regional integration system has been defined."" II. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND ITS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION SICA enjoys international recognition. As an example, at their meeting in Brazil, on 15 and 16 July 1993, the Ibero-American Heads of State and Government stated: d/ ""We recognize the importance of the entry into force, on 1 February 1993, of the Central American Integration System (SICA), under the Tegucigalpa Protocol, whose main objective is to establish Central America as a region of democracy, development, peace and freedom, based principally on the respect, safeguard and promotion of human rights. We exhort the States and international organizations involved to cooperate effectively so that SICA promotes and strengthens the subregional integration of Central America and achieves its basic aim."" For its part, on 10 June 1994, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution (AG/Doc.3157/94), welcoming the signing of the Cooperation Agreement between the General Secretariat of the Organization and the General Secretariat of SICA and calling for the establishment of a programme of cooperation between the two organizations. On 20 September 1994 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recognized SICA as an entity having consultative status. III. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM AND THE UNITED NATIONS SICA is the successor to OCAS, which was established by the Charter of San Salvador, signed on 12 December 1962 by five Central American States. As such, it is also a regional arrangement within the meaning of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Its influence also extends into the field of activity covered in Chapter IX (Articles 55 and 56). The relationship between the United Nations and SICA is one of complementarity, since the United Nations is an organization of a universal nature and SICA is a subregional integration organization one of whose basic principles is respect for the principles and norms of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations will strengthen the realization of its aims and purposes at the international level by effectively coordinating its world-wide activities with those of subregional organizations, in this case, with SICA. The participation of SICA as an observer in the General Assembly of the United Nations will help the subregional organization reaffirm and consolidate Central American self-determination in external affairs, through a common strategy which will strengthen the participation of the region as a whole in the international field. In its resolution 49/137 of 19 December 1994, entitled ""The situation in Central America: Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development"", the General Assembly declared that it was aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments for the consolidation of a firm peace in Central America, and that the Central American Integration System constituted the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development could be promoted in an effective, orderly and coherent manner.
