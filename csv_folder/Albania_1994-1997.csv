at its thirty-third session (E/CN.6/1989/6/Add.1), women are especially vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the economic and E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 3 social impact of AIDS as a result of their disadvantageous legal, social and economic status, and concerned at the increasing rate of HIV infection among women and girls, Expresses its grave concern that the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses the risk of transmission of HIV, Concerned at evidence indicating that groups in society suffering discrimination in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and disadvantage with respect to their access to education, health care and social services, are as a result more vulnerable to the risk of infection and to the personal and social impact of the pandemic, Alarmed at discriminatory laws and policies and the emergence of new forms of discriminatory practices with regard to access to health care, employment, education, housing and social welfare which deny people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, as well as high-risk groups, enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms, Concerned that the fear and ignorance surrounding HIV/AIDS are leading to increased stigmatization of and prejudice against people living with HIV/AIDS or presumed to be at risk of infection, sometimes resulting in intimidation, harassment or violence against such individuals, as well as to arbitrary detention and deportation, Bearing in mind that, as recognized by the World Health Assembly in its resolution WHA45.35, there is no public health rationale for any measures that limit the rights of the individual, notably measures establishing mandatory screening, Stressing that discrimination and stigmatization are counter-productive to measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, and that anti-discrimination measures form a component part of an effective public health strategy, Emphasizing the responsibility of Governments to take measures to counter social stigmatization of and discrimination against those affected by HIV/AIDS, and their commitment to strengthen national and international mechanisms that are concerned with HIV/AIDS-related human rights and ethics, Recognizing that HIV transmission can be prevented through informed and responsible behaviour, and emphasizing the role and responsibility of individuals, groups and organs of society aimed at promoting, in a spirit of E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 4 human solidarity and tolerance, a social environment supportive of the effective prevention and eradication of the root causes of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Welcoming the report by the Secretary-General on international and domestic measures taken to protect human rights and prevent discrimination in the context of HIV/AIDS (E/CN.4/1995/45) and his recommendations therein, but noting with concern that there is insufficient information about successful strategies for protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, 1. Confirms that discrimination on the basis of AIDS or HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that the term ""or other status"" in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts can be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS; 2. Calls _upon all States to ensure, where necessary, that their laws, policies and practices, including those introduced in the context of HIV/AIDS, respect human rights standards, including the right to privacy and integrity of people living with HIV/AIDS, prohibit HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and do not have the effect of inhibiting programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV/AIDS; 3. Also calls upon all States to take all the necessary steps, including appropriate and speedy redress procedures and the introduction of protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimination, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people presumed to be at risk of infection, with particular attention to women, children and vulnerable groups, and to address such concerns within their activities in the context of the International Year of Tolerance, 1995; 4, Further calls upon all States to strengthen their efforts to advance the legal, economic and social status of women, children and vulnerable groups in order to render them less vulnerable to the risk of HIV infection and to the adverse socio-economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic; 5. Recognizes the need to protect women and girls from sexual abuse and violence and calls upon the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Working Group on E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 5 Contemporary Forms of Slavery to pay sustained attention to the risk which the continuing exploitation of children, including child prostitution, poses for the transmission of HIV; 6. Invites States to involve non-governmental and community-based organizations and people living with HIV/AIDS in the formulation and implementation of public policies, including the support of participatory programmes for prevention, care and social support among vulnerable and marginalized populations; 7. Calls upon States to take all necessary steps, in particular appropriate education and information measures, to facilitate informed and responsible behaviour; 8. Invites the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other similar bodies to give full attention to monitoring States partiesâ compliance with their commitments under the relevant human rights instruments regarding the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, or people presumed to be at risk of infection; 9. Calls upon the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to keep the issue of AIDS-related discrimination under continuous review under all relevant agenda items, as well as within the work of its relevant working groups and special rapporteurs; 10. Calls upon relevant professional bodies to re-examine their codes of professional practice with a view to strengthening respect for human rights and dignity in the context of HIV/AIDS, and calls upon the relevant authorities to develop training in this regard; United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS to integrate a strong human rights component throughout the strategies and work of the future programme; 12. Requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider appropriate methods by which to keep under continuous review the protection of human rights in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to undertake with the Centre for Human Rights, in cooperation with the joint and co-sponsored United Nations programme, non-governmental agencies and other actors in the field, the task of elaborating guidelines on promoting and protecting respect E/CN.4/1995/L.59 page 6 for human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, and to reflect in this regard on the possibility of organizing a second international expert consultation on human rights and AIDS; 13. Requests the Secretary-General to consult with Governments, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations with a view to keeping under review the protection of human rights in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to prepare for the consideration of the Commission at its fifty-second session a progress report on the development of a human rights component in the joint and co-sponsored United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS and on the status of the guidelines mentioned in paragraph 12.",02/28/1995,1995_171567,Albania,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of 1 1.

which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the

than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons, Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 A of 23 December 1994, calling for assistance in mine clearance, Welcoming the programmes of assistance which exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines, Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine

reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1.

reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts established pursuant to Security Council resolution 935 (1994), that genocide and systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda and that the situation of ethnic and political armed conflict in Rwanda resulted in other grave violations and abuses of human rights, including violation of the right to life, the right to physical and moral integrity, the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to be free from discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin and to be protected from incitement to such discrimination, Reaffirming the deep concern expressed by the World Conference on Human
