Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, took a step which came to emphasize its commitment to democracy and formally offered Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, as the site for the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. 2. The Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was held in Managua from 4 to 6 July 1994, with the support of the United Nations and friendly countries and the participation of ministers and high-level representatives.

In order to achieve the objectives put forward by the Conference, the Plan of Action drew attention to the need to work out and strengthen at the bilateral and multilateral level modalities for international cooperation that take into account the various realities of the new or restored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy and peace with development. 6.

We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War.

2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people

prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after

of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 of 23 December 1994 on assistance in mine clearance, both adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/79 of 8 March 1995 on the rights of the child, 1/ Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine clearance efforts by the international community, Recognizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, in accordance with international law, Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, the health and the lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Conscious of the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine- clearance techniques, as well as the need for improvements thereof and the lack of global coordination in the field of research to improve mine-clearance technology and the urgent need to foster international technical cooperation in this field, Aware that the rate of mine clearance needs to improve substantially if the global land-mine problem is to be effectively tackled, Recalling its resolution 50/74 of 12 December 1995 on the Convention on Prohibitions or

in the mandates of several peace- keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and see solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the Secretary-General through the work of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat in increasing public awareness of the problem of land-mines and for the establishment of the Central
