Herzegovina established by the Washington Agreement of 18 March 1994, which also constitutes a democratic model for the reconciliation of all peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the territory of the

territory of the former Yugoslavia (E/CN.4/1995/37), Grateful for the work of the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights and of all those involved in the humanitarian relief effort,

further deterioration in the situation of human rights and that its purpose may be to change the demographic composition of Kosovo, Noting with anguish the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, in particular his seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth periodic reports (E/CN.4/1995/4, E/CN.4/1995/10, A/49/641-S/1994/1252,

Strongly condemns the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur in his reports, most of which are committed in connection with the systematic policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocidal acts in the areas of the former Yugoslavia under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities, and which include mass killing, torture, disappearances, rape, and other sexual abuses against women and children, use of civilians as human shields on confrontation lines and as mine clearers, arbitrary executions, destruction of houses, religious objects and cultural and historical heritage, forced and illegal evictions, detentions, arbitrary searches and other acts of violence; 4.
