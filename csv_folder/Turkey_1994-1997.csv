Strongly condemns the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur in his reports, most of which are committed in connection with the systematic policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocidal acts in the areas of the former Yugoslavia under the control of the self-proclaimed Serb authorities, and which include mass killing, torture, disappearances, rape, and other sexual abuses against women and children, use of civilians as human shields on confrontation lines and as mine clearers, arbitrary executions, destruction of houses, religious objects and cultural and historical heritage, forced and illegal evictions, detentions, arbitrary searches and other acts of violence; 4.

Also condemns all deliberate and arbitrary impeding of the delivery of food, medical and other supplies essential for the civilian population, in particular of the Bihac area, which can constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and of medical evacuations, as well as attacks on and continued harassment of the United Nations Protection Force and on personnel working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations, which have caused injuries to and the death of those who seek to protect civilians and to deliver humanitarian assistance, and demands that all parties ensure that all persons under their control cease all such attacks and acts of harassment; 18. Renews its expression of outrage at the use of the systematic practice of rape as a weapon of war against women and children and as an instrument of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the areas of armed conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and again recognizes that rape in these circumstances constitutes a war crime; E/CN.4/1995/L.88/Rev.1 page 10 19. Reaffirms that all persons who perpetrate or authorize violations of international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable, and should be brought to justice in accordance with internationally recognized principles of due process; 20.
