In many important and relevant spheres, such as social and humanitarian problems and cooperation for development, we witness closely concerted efforts undertaken by regional associations and the United Nations. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which has formed its organizational structure by adopting the Charter on 22 January 1993, is acquiring its particular place among such regional arrangements. 2.

The first results of their cooperation demonstrate a meaningful potential of interaction between the Commonwealth and the universal international Organization on the basis of partnership, participation and complementarity of efforts. 3. As we see it, the time has come when mostly occasional contacts between CIS and the United Nations should be put on a more regular and orderly basis. This aim could be best achieved by the granting to the Commonwealth of observer status in the General Assembly .

Inter-agency cooperation is vital for ensuring the mobilization of resources and the effective implementation of a coordinated programme of activities throughout the United Nations system. 6. The programme will draw upon the experience and strengths of the six co-sponsors to develop its strategies and policies, which will be incorporated in turn into their programmes and activities. The co-sponsors will share responsibility for the development of the programme, will contribute equally to its strategic direction, and will receive from it policy and technical guidance relating to the implementation of their HIV/AIDS activities. In this way, the programme will also serve to harmonize the HIV/AIDS activities of the co-sponsors. 7. The programme will be managed by a director who will focus on the programmeâs overall strategy, technical guidance, research and development, and the global budget. The co-sponsors will contribute to the resource needs of the programme at levels to be determined. The World Health Organization will be responsible for the administration in support of the programme. 8. Other United Nations system organizations concerned with the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be encouraged to join the programme as co-sponsors in the future. III. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES 9. The programme will build on the capacities and comparative advantages of the co-sponsors. At the global level, the programme will provide support in policy formulation, strategic planning, technical guidance, research and development, advocacy and external relations. This will include normative activities relating to HIV/AIDS in areas such as social and economic planning, population, culture, education, community development and social mobilization, sexual and reproductive health, and women and adolescents. 10. At the country level, the programme will provide support to the resident coordinator system. Co-sponsors will incorporate the normative work undertaken at the global level on policy, strategy and technical matters into their HIV/AIDS activities, consistent with national plans and priorities. An important function of the programme will be to strengthen national capacities to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the overall response to HIV/AIDS. The participation in the programme of six organizations of the United Nations system will ensure the provision of technical and financial assistance to national activities in a coordinated multisectoral manner. This will strengthen intersectoral coordination of HIV/AIDS activities and will facilitate further incorporation of these activities in national programme and planning processes. IV. FLOW OF PROGRAMME FUNDS 12. Funds for programme activities at the global level will be obtained through appropriate common global means. Contributions to the programme will be channelled in accordance with the global budget and work plan. 13. Funding for country-level activities will be obtained primarily through existing fund-raising mechanisms of the co-sponsors. These funds will be channelled through the disbursement mechanisms and procedures of each organization. V. FIELD-LEVEL COORDINATION 14. It is recognized that national Governments have the ultimate responsibility for the coordination of HIV/AIDS issues at the country level. To this end, the arrangements of the programme for coordinating HIV/AIDS activities will complement and support national development planning. 15. The coordination of field-level activities will be undertaken through the United Nations resident coordinator system within the framework of General Assembly resolutions 44/211 and 47/199. This will involve a theme group on HIV/AIDS established by the resident coordinator and comprising representatives of the six co-sponsors and other United Nations system organizations. The chairperson of the theme group will be selected by consensus from among the United Nations system representatives. It is intended that the theme group will help the United Nations system integrate more effectively its efforts with national coordination mechanisms. To support the coordination process, ina number of countries the programme will recruit a country staff member, who will assist the chairperson of the theme group in carrying out his or her functions. VI. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 16. A programme director will be appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the co-sponsors. This will follow a search process undertaken by the co-sponsors which will include consultation with Governments and other interested parties. The director will report directly to the programme coordinating board, which will serve as the governance structure for the programme. Annual reports prepared by the director will be submitted to the board, and will also be made available to the governing body of each of the co-sponsors. 17. The composition of the programme coordinating board will be determined on the basis of open-ended consultations, as outlined in operative paragraph 11 of the present resolution. In exercising its governance role, the board will have ultimate responsibility for all policy and budgetary matters. It will also review and decide upon the planning and execution of the programme. Its detailed responsibilities and meeting schedule will be specified in a terms of reference document, which is currently being developed. 18. The programme will also have a committee of co-sponsoring organizations, which will serve as a standing committee of the board. It will comprise one representative from each of the co-sponsors. The committee will meet regularly and will facilitate the input of the co-sponsors into the strategy, policies and operations of the programme. 19. Through consultation with interested non-governmental organizations, a mechanism will be established to ensure their meaningful participation in the programme, so that they can provide information, perspectives and advice to the board, based on their experience and involvement with HIV/AIDS issues.",07/20/1994,1994_191736,Russian Federation,"* In accordance with rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council. 1 1.

ANNEX Declaration in Commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversar of the End of the Second World War 1. We, the representatives of the States Members of the United Nations, have gathered at a solemn meeting of the fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which brought untold suffering and ravages to mankind. (E) 121095 121095 Joes 2. In this World Year of Peopleâs Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression. 3. We note that the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war - was one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War. We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/ 4. We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the ""cold war"" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element. 5. We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon humanity in general. We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts, to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world: (a) To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use of threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; (b) To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars and racial hatred, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts; (c) To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture; (d) To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom. 6. The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War.
