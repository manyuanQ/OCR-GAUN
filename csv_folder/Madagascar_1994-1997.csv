1994,General Assembly,Forty-eighth session,N/A,UNITED NATIONS A,"Upon instructions from my Government, I have the honour to request, in accordance with rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the forty-eighth session of the Assembly of an additional item of an urgent character entitled ""Emergency assistance to Madagascar"". Please find attached, in accordance with rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,",N/A,N/A,"1. Madagascar, situated between 12Â° and 25Â° latitude south, is particularly prone to tropical cyclones, whose season lasts from November to April. On average, Madagascar and the neighbouring islands are struck each year by seven cyclones; and out of five of the most common trajectories of violent cyclones originating in the Indian Ocean, four strike the country with full force. Since the beginning of the 1993/1994 season, Madagascar has suffered especially hard from the following two cyclones. 2. Daisy, from 13 to 17 January 1994, with an intensity of 5.5Â° on the Dvorak scale (which goes up to 7), characterized by winds sustained for 10 minutes at a speed exceeding 160 km/h with gusts of 250 km/h, and affecting the provinces of Toamasina, Fianarantsoa and Toliara; and Geralda, from 2 to 4 February 1994, with an intensity of 7Â° on the Dvorak scale, classified as the most powerful cyclone in the world since 1927, characterized by winds sustained for 10 minutes at a speed exceeding 250 km/h with gusts of 350 km/h, and affecting the provinces of Toamasina, Antananarivo and Toliara. 3. The violent winds, accompanied by torrential and sustained precipitation and rains, resulted in swollen rivers and devastating floods. The situation is described below on the basis of information received to date. I. VICTIMS 4, The cyclones Daisy and Geralda caused the death of 43 people. Out of 5,423,119 inhabitants directly affected, some 500,000 suffered injury or loss, including 80,000 in the city of Toamasina and 30,000 in the city of Antananarivo. The priority needs of the people affected in terms of foodstuffs, care and shelter largely involve the supply of rice (20,000 tons), flour (10,000 tons), cooking oil (4,000 barrels of 200 litres), powdered milk (500 tons), sugar (500 tons), soap and other essential items, blankets, clothing (for 500,000 people, 60 per cent of them children and 40 per cent adults), vaccines, medicine, rescue equipment, camping equipment, fuel and kerosine. II. DAMAGE CAUSED TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS 5. The two cyclones damaged or destroyed a large number of public buildings (schools, hospitals, prisons, barracks) and private buildings. 6. The most serious damage occurred on the east coast, where 95 per cent of the dwellings were flattened. The damage has been provisionally estimated at $1,888,000 in respect of the buildings of the Post and Telecommunications and of the Agency for the Safety of Air Navigation in Madagascar and Africa (ASECNA), and the storage installations of the refinery at Toamasina. A/48/247 production have been damaged or completely destroyed as a result of landslides, floods, and the destruction of bridges and roadworks. The cost of emergency restoration of these highways is put at $1,380,000. The two lines of the Malagasy railway, one of which is vital for the supply of provisions to the capital, have been damaged as a result of landslides, tunnel obstructions and track flooding. Restoration of railway traffic will require $2,650,000. 9. The cyclones disrupted the supply of running water in the three major cities on the east coast and seriously damaged the electric grid in the same region and in several localities on the high plateaux. The emergency repair and restoration work is estimated at $ 1. 7 million. The damage suffered by the telecommunications network (infrastructure and equipment) amounts to $2.4 million. 10. Lastly, the cyclone Geralda seriously damaged industrial installations in the main port city of Toamasina, namely, the factory for PROLUMA lubricating products and the SOLIMA (National Hydrocarbons Corporation) refinery, and the work involved in getting them running again will last three to four months and will cost $800,000. IV. AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK 12. The main regions devoted to rice farming and market gardening have been severely hit, either by the direct impact of the cyclones or by the floods: 70 per cent of the paddy-fields are flooded, probably irretrievably. The possibility that the embankment protecting against overflow on the river Ikopa near the capital might rupture aggravates the threat of a shortage of rice, the staple food of the population. The price of this essential commodity has, in fact, already doubled. The farm drainage network has also suffered considerable damage. 13. The cash crops for processing and export have also been sorely affected; 90 per cent of the plantations on the island of Sainte Marie, for example, have been ravaged, and the harvests of coffee, vanilla, cloves, lychees, etc., on the east coast are likely to be severely affected for several years to come. 14. The Malagasy Government, together with the National Aid Council and with the active participation of the population, reacted immediately by mobilizing all the available means in order to provide emergency aid and assistance to the victims. 15.

which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on the export of anti-personnel land-mines, Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting that according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Assistance in mine clearance"", 1/ it is estimated that there are more than 110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the world, Noting also that according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated 2 million to 5 million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994, Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons, Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 A of 23 December 1994, calling for assistance in mine clearance, Welcoming the programmes of assistance which exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines, Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine Clearance held at Geneva from 5 to 7 July 1995, and noting the statement of the Secretary-General at the meeting that the international community must take specific and tangible steps to address the ""intolerable situation caused by the proliferation of anti-personnel land-mines throughout the world"", Recalling with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General concerning progress on the initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 2/ Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land- mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices, Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions, Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 3/ particularly Protocol II, 4/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines, Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the aforementioned Convention held at Vienna in September and October 1995 to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibition and restrictions when the conference reconvenes in January and April 1996, Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other Measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement, Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis, 1. Welcomes the moratoria already declared by certain States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines; 2. Urges States that have not yet done so to declare such moratoria at the earliest possible date; 3. Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report on steps taken by Member States to implement such moratoria, and to submit it to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session under the item entitled ""General and complete disarmament""; 4.
